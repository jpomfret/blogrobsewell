>Chrissy LeMaire&lt;/a> and CKs pre-con, this year I decided to add a US SQL Saturday to the list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shall be attending &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/808/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>dbatools&lt;/a>. I am really lucky, my amazing Dad, now that he is retired, happily plays Dadâ€™s taxi (still!) and frequently drives me to the airport when I go away on trips. This is the first time he has really gone Wow! When I asked why, it is because Portland is where &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830617/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Grimm is filmed&lt;/a> and he has watched the whole series and loved it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am looking forward to ticking off another thing on my list of things to do and presenting at a US SQL Saturday to add to 12 SQL Saturday cities in Europe and multiple other events around the world. If you are there come up and say hi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shall also be room monitoring for theÂ &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/808/Speakers/Details.aspx?name=amy-herold&amp;amp;spid=1767" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>sign up here&lt;/a> if you are going. It is a lot of fun and an excellent way to give something back. SQL Saturdays take a lot of work to organise and organisers are always willing for some help. You will meet new people and have a lot of fun as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get to Seattle I am going on the SQL Train. A whole bunch of data platform folk travelling on a train together up to Seattle for PASS Summit. It looks like it will be a lot of fun ðŸ™‚&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once in Seattle it is time for the week where others will not want to look at my twitter feed ðŸ™‚ A whole week at PASS Summit watching the sessions and networking (there may be beer involved) with our peers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My one piece of advice is please donâ€™t hide away in your hotel room for all of the time that sessions are not on. I know that dealing with a large amount of people can be tough and you might need some me time ( I will ) but there are a lot of activities both loud and quieter where you will have the opportunity to meet up and make new friends and contacts which may really pay back further down the line and you will have fun too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the Tuesday I am doing a pre-conference sessionÂ Professional and Proficient PowerShell: From Writing Scripts to Developing Solutions. A whole day where I will be showing how to write PowerShell modules and all of the tips and tricks that I have learnt over the years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wednesday sees me embracing my inner &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/AndreKamman" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>AndrÃ© Kamman&lt;/a>Â â€“ unfortunately he is unable to make PASS Summit this year, so I will be delivering the sessionÂ dbatools Powershell Library â€“ The Complete Introduction in his place in room 2AB. I shall try to do it in as cool and relaxed a way as he does (It probably wont work I will get too excited ðŸ™‚ )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Thursday I will be talking about &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbachecks.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dbachecks&lt;/a> in room 6C which will also be streamed on PASSTv.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In between all of that, I shall be attending some networking events, visiting sessions, hanging out with people new and old and walking down the corridors, so if you see me, stop me and say hi, Iâ€™d love to meet you ðŸ™‚&lt;br>
(note â€“ just before my sessions I may be too nervous to properly have a conversation)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully, I will meet you there and for the twitter folk stuck back in Europe I empathise ðŸ™‚&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PASS Summit, SQLTrain and My First US SQL Saturday</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/pass-summit-sqltrain-and-my-first-us-sql-saturday/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/pass-summit-sqltrain-and-my-first-us-sql-saturday/</guid><description>&lt;p>Next week is the week when I used to dread looking at Twitter and especially the &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23passsummit&amp;amp;src=typd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
