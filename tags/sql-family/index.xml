>you search for them&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managing SQL servers at enterprise scale is not a straightforward task. Your aim as a DBA should be to simplify it as much as possible and to automate everything that you possibly can. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.johnsansom.com/the-best-database-administrators-automate-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>This post by John Sansom&lt;/a> could have been written for this months party and I recommend that you read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here are a few points that I think you should consider if you look after SQL in an Enterprise environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Enterprise Strategy will undoubtedly garner a whole host of excellent posts and Jen will provide a round up post which will I am certain will be an excellent resource. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2015/09/the-tsql2sday-70-roundup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Take a look here&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Know where your instances are and have a single place that you can reference them from. Some people recommend a &lt;a class="link" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb895144.aspx?f=255&amp;amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Central Management Server&lt;/a> but I find this too restrictive for my needs. I use an InstanceList table in my DBA Database with the following columns [ServerName], [InstanceName] , [Port] , [AG] , [Inactive] , [Environment] and [Location]. This enables me to target instances not just by name but by environment (Dev, Test, Pre-Prod, Live etc), by location or by joining the InstanceList table with another table I can target by the application or any number of other factors. I also capture information about the servers at windows and SQL level to this database so I can target the SQL 2012 servers specifically if need be or any other metric. This is very powerful and enables far greater flexibility than the CMS in my opinion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use PowerShell (no surprise I would mention this!) PowerShell is a brilliant tool for automation and I use it all of the time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get used to using this piece of PowerShell code&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> $Connection = $ServerName + &amp;#39;\&amp;#39; + $InstanceName + &amp;#39;,&amp;#39; + $Port

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Notice the query variable above, this is where the power lies as it enables you to gather all the instances that you need for your task as described in the bullet post above. Once you get used to doing this you can do things like this identify all the instances with Remote DAC disabled using a query against the DBA Database and then enable it on all servers by adding this code to the loop above&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$srv.RemoteDacEnabled = $true
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$srv.alter()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Very quick very simple and very very powerful. You can also use this to run TSQL scripts against the instances you target but there are some &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=issues%20with%20invoke-sqlcmd&amp;amp;form=EDGEAR&amp;amp;qs=PF&amp;amp;cvid=bafe07c6afd54a6cb0ce7a1583300a79&amp;amp;pq=issues%20with%20invoke-sqlcmd&amp;amp;elv=AF!A!XC!KoOyC2FxnVd!deIwlgRcylR4EqUAG2rfVDNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>added complications with Invoke-SQLCmd&lt;/a> that you need to be aware of&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>BE CAREFUL. Test and understand and test before you run any script on a live system especially using a script like this which enables you to target ALL of your servers. You must definitely check that your $ServerNames array contains only the instances you need before you make any changes. You need to be ultra-cautious when it is possible to do great damage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write scripts that are robust and handle errors gracefully. I use Jason Wasser @wasserja Write-Log function to write to a text file and wrap my commands in a try catch block.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Include comments in your scripts to assist either the future you or the folks in your position in 5 years time. I would also add one of my bug bears - Use the description block in Agent Jobs. The first place any DBA is going to go to when that job fails is to open the properties of the job. Please fill in that block so that anyone troubleshooting knows some information about what the job does or at the very least a link to some documentation about it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally in my list, don&amp;rsquo;t overdo the alerts. Alerting is vital for any DBA it is a brilliant way to ensure that you quickly know about any issues affecting your estate but &lt;a class="link" href="http://thomaslarock.com/2012/02/the-minimalist-guide-to-database-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>all alerts should be actionable&lt;/a> and in some cases you can automate the action that you can take but the message here is don&amp;rsquo;t send messages to the DBA team email for every single tiny thing or they will get swamped and ignore the vital one. This holds for whichever alerting or monitoring system that you use&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is but a small sub-section of things that you need to consider when responsible for a large SQL estate but if you need help and advice or just moral support and you don’t already interact with the SQL community then make today the day you start.

&lt;p>Disclaimer – I am on the committee organising the next &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlsouthwest.co.uk/sqlsat269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Saturday Exeter&lt;/a>. To be kept up to date about SQL Saturday #269 in the South West, follow &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sqlsatexeter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@SQLSatExeter&lt;/a> and&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sqlsatexeter&amp;amp;src=hash&amp;amp;f=realtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>#SQLSatExeter&lt;/a> on twitter and see details at the bottom. This post is about my experience at this years event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In March this year the SQL South West User Group hosted SQL Saturday #194 in Exeter. I was a new member to the User Group having finally been able to join them for the first time in January. At that meeting Chris Testa O’Neill presented a session and was very passionate about the SQL Community and the benefit of the SQL Saturdays and other events.  I am always keen to learn new things and find ways of developing my skills. As I haven’t won the lottery I also look out for good deals as well!!&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sql-saturday-pre-cons-are-exceptional-value">SQL SATURDAY PRE-CONS ARE EXCEPTIONAL VALUE&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It was relatively easy to persuade my bosses to pay for my pre-con. For £150 I was able to spend a whole day in a room with about a dozen people being trained in SQL Server Security by Denny Cherry &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/@mrdenny" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@mrdenny&lt;/a>. The conversation went along the lines of&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I want to go to this training session being delivered by this guy. &lt;a class="link" href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Denny%20Cherry-4021851" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Link to MVP page&lt;/a>. It’s £150 and is in Exeter so no other costs required”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My boss – “OK”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course there was a little more fun and games to be had with the payment but it was easy for me to get training sorted and £150 is not going to break the training budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back through my notes from the session today I realise quite how much I have taken from it into my role at work. I can’t really comment which and what though that wouldn’t be good security!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember an enjoyable day with plenty of technical learning, a lot of questions and answers and plenty of laughs as well. But more than that was the opportunity to mix with other professionals and talk with them. During the breaks and at lunch there were plenty of opportunities to chew the fat, learn how others do things, make new friends and put faces to twitter handles. (NOTE : I do look pretty much like my &lt;a class="link" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/75950380/n675059923_1450.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>twitter profile picture&lt;/a> so if you see me at SQL Community events I expect you to come up and say hi, that&amp;rsquo;s part of the benefit of attending these events, having a good natter)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take a look at the end of this post for details of 2014 Pre-Cons&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sql-saturday--cant-get-cheaper-than-free">SQL SATURDAY – CAN’T GET CHEAPER THAN FREE&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>SQL Saturdays are FREE&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Saturdays offer sessions from internationally renowned and local SQL speakers on subjects relevant to you and your job, your future career, your development plan or just to challenge yourself by learning about something outside of your comfort zone. For Nothing. Add in the networking opportunities, the prizes from the sponsors, (if you were at Exeter this year the beer and the pasty) and if you added it up its a sizeable investment in yourself, your career and your development (did I mention a free beer and pasty?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NOT BAD FOR FREE!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable that, SQL Saturday organisers have to go out and talk sponsors into putting their hands into their pockets. They will only do that if it is worthwhile to them. You can make it easier for the organisers by going and spending time with the sponsors during the breaks, chatting with them and giving them your details. Also, if you choose to use one of their products please tell the sponsors you spoke to them at a SQL Saturday. They are (usually) data professionals who will record that and use that to make future decisions which will we hope include sponsoring SQL Saturdays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year on the Saturday I went to the following sessions&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A temporary fix for a short term problem by Ian Meade Advanced SQL Server 2012 HA and DR Architectures by Christian Bolton Busting common T-SQL myths by Dave Morrison Power View and the Cube by Régis Baccaro Natural Born Killers, performance issues to avoid by Richard Douglas Tracking server performance without slowing it down by Jonathan Allen which I also Room Monitored Increasing Business and IT collaboration by Chris Testa-O&amp;rsquo;Neill&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a really good day. I learnt so much from all those knowledgeable and talented people. It really kicked me on in my development at work. I was able to take from each of those sessions and use that knowledge to do my job better and I made new friends and new contacts. Just going back to my notes today has reminded me of something that I need to look into for work.
Some of the conversations I have had at events this year have been fascinating - learning how other people do the same thing you do in a completely different but equally valid way,  problem-solving with a different set and type of minds than the ones at MyWork, laughing at the same things and moaning about similar frustrations. All have been both entertaining and rewarding and I think are worth mentioning as things I enjoyed about going to SQL Community events this year and play a part in the reason I shall continue to go to them (Just hope my boss doesn&amp;rsquo;t read this and think he won’t have to pay as I will go anyway!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s busy and hectic, the sessions come along thick and fast and there are lots of people around to talk to. I wish I had made use of the SQL Saturday mobile phone app and I definitely recommend researching ahead of time and planning your day out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This years sessions have not been decided yet but I have seen some of the submissions and there are some fabulous sessions there. You could also submit a session yourself. Choosing the sessions will be tough, but we want to offer the opportunity to speak to as many people as possible both new and experienced speakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can submit your sessions at this link &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/269/callforspeakers.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>For a newbie, as I was last time, SQL Saturday Exeter was a revelation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An opportunity to learn without spending thousands of my own or MyWorks money to sit in a lecture room and listen to a trainer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A chance to develop my understanding in a friendly environment amongst my peers where I could ask questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A place to meet new people and build relationships who have helped me with situations at work throughout the year. I reckon I&amp;rsquo;m in credit already&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year I have attended SQL Bits and SQL Saturday Cambridge and this month I shall be at SQL Relay in Cardiff and in Bristol. That all started with SQL Saturday 194 in Exeter 2013&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-about-next-years-sql-saturday-exeter">WHAT ABOUT NEXT YEARS SQL SATURDAY EXETER?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Next years SQL Saturday in Exeter, SQL Saturday #269, will be held at the same place - &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.jurysinns.com/hotels/exeter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jury’s Inn Hotel Exeter&lt;/a> on March 21/22nd 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had such amazing submissions for our pre-cons that we have had to find more rooms to be able to fit them all in.. You can see for yourself the quality of the sessions and speakers for SQL Saturday Exeter 2014 at the following link&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This bit is up to you, the choice is hard. I can’t tell you which one of our eight fabulous sessions you want to go to. It’s not for me to say which amazing speaker you want to spend a day with for a bargain price but if you need further info please get in touch and we will try and help. Unfortunately our human cloning experiment is not stable enough to allow you to go to more than one!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, let me know you have done so and come and say hi when you are here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
