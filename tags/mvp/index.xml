&lt;p>Today, July 1st is the date that many MVPs receive their renewal email to let them know that they have been awarded for another year. There is a lot of F5’ing and frequent checking of emails and “Have you heard yet?” DMs going around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I received the news, I was using Azure DevOps to run PowerShell and Terraform to build an Azure SQL Elastic Pool (yes, I will write a blog post about it!). I love technology and within my work, like many people, I work across many different disciplines. Azure, Azure DevOps, SQL Server and Microsoft Data Platform products are the main focus of my time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn’t notice the significance of the information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was pleased as punch to be renewed again, proud that what I do is recognised by Microsoft, honoured to spend another year as an MVP. Then my friends pointed out the big news that I had missed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are two award categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been awarded for both Cloud and Datacenter Management and Data Platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am beyond words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proud, Surprised and Honoured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to all of the people who help and support me. You help more than you will ever know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to go and prop my jaw shut!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Powershell won’t save when running as a scheduled job</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/powershell-wont-save-when-running-as-a-scheduled-job/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/powershell-wont-save-when-running-as-a-scheduled-job/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="or-how-sqlbits-put-me-in-touch-with-laerte-and-solved-a-problem">Or, How SQLBits put me in touch with Laerte and solved a problem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have a scheduled Powershell job which I use to create an Excel file colour coded for backup checks. (I will blog about it another time) It works brilliantly on my desktop and saves the file to a UNC path and emails the team the location. It works brilliantly when run in Powershell on the server. When I schedule it to run though it doesn’t do so well. The job completes without errors but no file is saved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you examine the processes running at the time you can see the excel process is running  so I knew it was doing something but couldn’t work out why it was failing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was one of those jobs that gets put to the bottom of the list because the service worked ok I just needed to have it running on the server rather than a desktop for resilience, recovery and security purposes. Every now and then I would try and work out what was going on but new work and new problems would always arrive and it has been like that for 6 or maybe even 9 months.&lt;/p>

>As you know&lt;/a> I attended SQLBits this weekend and I went into a session with Laerte Junior. Laerte is a SQL Server MVP and can be found at &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.simple-talk.com/author/laerte-junior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>After a fascinating session I asked him if I could show him my problem. He very graciously said yes and after looking at the code and listening to me explain the problem he suggested this very simple solution which he said had taken him a great deal of searching to find. It’s a bug with COM objects and requires the creation of folders as shown below. I cam into work today, tried it and it worked. HOORAY another thing off my list and big thanks to Laerte&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>#Region Bug_Jobs_ComObjects #(32Bit, always)
# Create Folder #
New-Item –name C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\Desktop  –itemtype directory
# #(64Bit)
# Create folder #
New-Item –name C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\Desktop  –itemtype directory
#EndRegion Bug_Jobs_ComObjects
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This worked for me however I had already implemented another fix for a possible gotcha so I will tell you of that one too&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes Powershell cannot save to UNC paths because of  IE enhanced security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Either log in as user and add server to intranet site zones or disable the warning in registry as follows&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap] &amp;quot;UNCAsIntranet&amp;quot;=dword:00000000
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please don’t ever trust anything you read on the internet and certainly don’t implement it on production servers without first both understanding what it will do and testing it thoroughly. This solution worked for me in my environment I hope it is of use to you in yours but I know nothing about your environment and you know little about mine&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
