&lt;p>As well as many other things, the fantastical &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Learn dbatools in a Month of Lunches&lt;/a>&lt;/em> that our publisherÂ &lt;a class="link" href="https://beard.media/bookblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Manning Publications&lt;/a> have agreed to release it as a MEAP. Not a text book, this book is written in a fun conversational style and split up into chapters that you can read in a lunch-time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is impossible for me to hear MEAP and not think of this ðŸ™‚&lt;/p>

&lt;p>but I expect you are wondering what a MEAP is?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is MEAP?&lt;br>
A book can take a year or more to write, so how do you learn that hot new technology today? The answer is MEAP, the Manning Early Access Program. In MEAP, you read a book chapter-by-chapter while itâ€™s being written and get the final eBook as soon as itâ€™s finished. If you pre-order the pBook, youâ€™ll get it long before itâ€™s available in stores.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.manning.com/meap-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.manning.com/meap-program&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Basically, to make it easy to get and for those that like to get in early, you can order the book and get the first 4 chapters (three in reality) RIGHT NOW!! (It also means that Chrissy and I have to write the rest of book â€“ dang still going to be busy!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply head over to &lt;a class="link" href="https://beard.media/bookblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://beard.media/bookblog&lt;/a> and use the code mlsewell and you can get access to the book too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This will also give you access to the live book.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>live book&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The live book is fantastic, you can read the whole book from within your browser. See the three icons that appear to the right of the book?&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3 little icons (no porridge)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The left hand one enables you to bookmark an important part so that you can come back to it easily using the bookmarks link in the top right&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/09/bookmark.png"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>bookmarks&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The middle icon enables you to write notes for yourself, maybe ways that you can use the information or maybe comments about an awesome Italian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/09/satori.png"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shoes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last one is the way that you can make comments and engage us , the authors in conversation, ask questions, request clarification or wonder about Dutch data manglers&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think its down to PII&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you select a piece of text, another menu opens up&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/09/highlight.png"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first icon lets you highlight the text, to make it easier to find later&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/09/highlightyellow.png"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hover over the highlight and you can choose different colours for different things.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>or even create pretty pictures for Mathias&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mathias â€“ Why isnâ€™t he an MVP?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can choose to annotate, which is sort of like highlighting and writing a note with the next icon&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When you want to share a link to a particular part of the book with someone else, you can highlight part of it and click the link icon&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Itâ€™s easy to start PowerShell as another user as long as you remember when to press SHIFT&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which will highlight the paragraph and open a dialogue at the bottom where you can create and copy the link.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By far the most important part for Chrissy and I is the last link. When you find something wrong you can mark it for our attention. Yes, even with Chrissy and I proof reading each others words, the fabulous proof reader ClÃ¡udio Silva (&lt;a class="link" href="https://claudioessilva.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>b&lt;/a>Â |Â &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/claudioessilva" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>t&lt;/a> has beaten you to it!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will have noticed on social media and elsewhere that we have left some easter eggs in the book&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Yup, we have some easter eggs in &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dbatoolsMol?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
