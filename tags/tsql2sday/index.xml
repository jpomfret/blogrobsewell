&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I want you to write about how you have used, or would like to use, a Jupyter notebook. This seemed to be exciting for many people at first, but I haven’t seen a lot of uptake from users in general. So I’m curious if you are using them.&lt;/p>

>I have written a few posts about them as well&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have a repository on GitHub with many notebooks &lt;a class="link" href="https://beard.media/Notebooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://beard.media/Notebooks&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have given presentations about notebooks &lt;a class="link" href="https://beard.media/presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://beard.media/presentations&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have videos on my youtube channel about notebooks &lt;a class="link" href="https://beard.media/notebooksyoutube" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;li>Integrate new team members&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a repository of incident response notebooks &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/jupyter%20notebooks/azure%20data%20studio/powershell/dynamically-creating-azure-data-studio-notebooks-with-powershell-for-an-incident-response-index-notebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dynamically created with Azure DevOps&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a repository of daily tasks notebooks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a repository of common large scale changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Off-load DBA requests to Service Desk with notebooks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use notebooks to demonstrate changes to Product Owners and other teams&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use notebooks for diagnosis by customers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use notebooks to investigate Azure environments and Azure Data Services&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and more&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I use notebooks to validate dbachecks PRs, to demonstrate &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/JupyterNotebooks/tree/master/notebooks/NotDotNet/dbachecks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Without tools, most of the work would be much harder to do or could not be done at all. Write a blog post about the most helpful and effective tools you use or know of.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

>The original post is here.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I miss Mikey, I worked in an office with him until the end of 2019. We used to sit next to each other which meant that I required some tools of my own!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sqldbawithbeard/status/1113346708631629824" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>We had a lot of fun and worked hard in Yorkshire (although he never learnt to make a proper cup of tea!) and both of us learnt new sayings&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="tools">Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Writing that gave me an idea for this blog post. Of course, I could have written about PowerShell, Azure Data Studio, dbatools, dbachecks or many of the other tools I use to deliver change and automate. You will find several good posts in this TSQL2sday series from people like &lt;a class="link" href="https://jesspomfret.com/t-sql-tuesday-135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>John Martin&lt;/a> showing some of those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, I am going to share some of my working from home tools that I cannot do without.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="coffee">Coffee&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Hello, my name is Rob and I drink a lot of coffee! I like to have coffee, I drink a lot of it so we got a coffee machine to make it easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/CoffeeMachine.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Coffee"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes beans, which we get delivered via Amazon and turns them into any sort of coffee you like with a press of a button.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="standing-desk">Standing Desk&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Spending a lot of time sitting down without moving much is not much good you and also really easy to do when you are working from home so I got a standing desk from &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Autonomous&lt;/a> Which I love. I normally start my morning sitting down, stand up for the standup! Then I will alternate throughout the day between sitting and standing or using my &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-stool" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>wibbly wobbly Autonomous stool&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bicycle">Bicycle&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With Covid I was not able to play any cricket last year. I really enjoyed playing cricket. I have played it since I was very small and having a reason to be out in the open, expending some energy and getting my competitive juices flowing was good for me. I have cycled in the past and enjoyed it. With the cricket team I cycled from John o&amp;rsquo; Groats to Lands End for charity a few years ago, so I bought a bike and now I again have a reason to go out in the fresh air and get my competitive juices going again, although I only compete against myself and compare my results on Strava with my previous times. Last year I started riding in April and rode 2897 miles. This gets me out into the beautiful south west UK countryside, expends some energy and keeps me moving, which I think is a good thing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/bikeride.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="bikeride"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="zwift">Zwift&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I told you a little fib, well maybe I just neglected the whole story. I &lt;em>did&lt;/em> ride 2897 last year but not all of them are outside. I found that I really enjoy cycling in the morning when I wake up but its not really safe when it is so dark or pleasant to do when the weather is rough, so I have a cycle trainer which I connect to Zwift. This enables me to ride with other people from all over the globe and explore various worlds, both real representations of London, New York and Paris and the virtual world of Watopia where you can see dolphins, whales, shipwrecks, dinosaurs or ride up and through a volcano. This can be really fun and certainly makes it easier for me to cycle more regularly. It has a number of gamifications and even allows you to ride through a tube station at midnight ! (note this was not at midnight but The Jam didnt sing about the tube station at 6-30am!!)&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="most-important-of-all-the-people">Most Important of all The People&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important tool though is the most useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The people who take their time to share knowledge, whether by blog posts, presentations, answering #sqlhelp on Twitter or just replying to a DM or an email. Those who organise virtual events or user groups, open source projects and community tooling like Data Saturdays and those who get paid for it as vendor evangelists or Microsoft or other companies employees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sheer range of knowledge that is readily and freely available with a simple courteous question is amazing and has certainly saved me a bunch of time and helped me out of some difficult to solve situations. Remember to be polite and appreciative of the time that they take out of their day and you will find they are willing to share their knowhow and help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to all of those people&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#tsql2sday #130 - Automate your stress away - Getting more SSIS Agent Job information</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/tsql2sday-130-automate-your-stress-away-getting-more-ssis-agent-job-information/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/tsql2sday-130-automate-your-stress-away-getting-more-ssis-agent-job-information/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/assets/images/TSQL2sDay150x150.jpg" alt="Featured image of post #tsql2sday #130 - Automate your stress away - Getting more SSIS Agent Job information" />&lt;h1 id="automation">Automation&lt;/h1>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Elizabeth asks&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My invitation to you is I want to know what you have automated to make your life easier?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="from-the-past">From the Past&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am in the process of migrating my blog to GitHub pages and whilst doing so, I read my first ever technical blog post &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/you-have-to-start-somewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>You have to start somewhere&lt;/a> In it I mention this blog post by John Sansom &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.johnsansom.com/the-best-database-administrators-automate-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Best Database Administrators Automate Everything&lt;/a> which I am pleased to see is still available nearly a decade later&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a quote from his blog entry&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="automate-everything">Automate Everything&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That’s right, I said everything. Just sit back and take the &lt;em>time&lt;/em> to consider this point for a moment. Let it wander around your mind whilst you consider the processes and tasks that you could look to potentially automate. Now eliminate the word &lt;em>potentially&lt;/em> from your vocabulary and evaluate how you could automate &lt;strong>e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g&lt;/strong> that you do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you believe that there is only a remote possibility that you will need to repeat a given task, just go ahead and automate it anyway! Chances are that when the need to repeat the process comes around again, you will either be under pressure to get it done, or even better have more important &lt;em>Proactive Mode&lt;/em> tasks/projects to be getting on with&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="i-love-automation">I love Automation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have tried my best at all times to follow this advice in the last decade and pretty much I am happy that I have managed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I use PowerShell (a lot!) to automate all sorts of routine tasks including migrating this blog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I use &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#jupyter-notebooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a> to enable myself and others to automate Run Books, Training, Documentation, Demonstrations, Incident Response. You can find my notebooks &lt;a class="link" href="https://beard.media/Notebooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I use Azure DevOps to automate infrastructure creation and changes with terraform and delivery of changes to code as well as unit testing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I use GitHub actions to create this blog, publish the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ADSNotebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ADSNotebook&lt;/a> module&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I use &lt;a class="link" href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Chocolatey&lt;/a> to install and update software&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have used Desired State Configuration to ensure that infrastructure is as it is expected to be&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At every point I am looking for a means to automate the thing that I am doing because it is almost guaranteed that there will be a time in the future after you have done a thing that there will be a need to do it again or to do it slightly differently.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-the-last-thing-that-you-automated">Whats the last thing that you automated?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Following my blog post about &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/notifying-a-teams-channel-of-a-sql-agent-job-result/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Notifying a Teams Channel about a SQL Agent Job result&lt;/a> I was asked if this could be tweaked to reduce the time spent getting information about SSIS Execution failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="finding-ssis-failures">Finding SSIS failures&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When you run an SSIS package in an Agent Job and it fails, the Agent Job History shows something along these lines&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The job failed. The Job was invoked by User MyDomain\MyUserName. The last step to run was step 1 (scheduling ssis package).
Executed as user: NT Service\SQLSERVERAGENT. Microsoft (R) SQL Server Execute Package Utility Version 11.0.5058.0 for 64-bit Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Started: 4:17:12 PM Package execution on IS Server failed. &lt;strong>Execution ID: 123456789&lt;/strong>, Execution Status:4. To view the details for the execution, right-click on the Integration Services Catalog, and open the [All Executions] report Started: 4:17:12 PM Finished: 4:17:12 PM Elapsed: 4.493 seconds. The package execution failed. The step failed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The next step is to open SSMS, go to the SSISDb and click through to the SSIS reports and then scroll through to find the package and then the message. This is not particularly efficient and the SSIS reports are not known for their speedy executions!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This meant that the team member responsible for checking in the morning, could see which instance and which job had failed from the Teams message but then had to manually follow the above steps to find an error message that they could take action on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="automate-it">Automate it&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the SSISDB database there is an &lt;code>event_messages&lt;/code> view so if I could query that and filter by the Execution ID then I could get the message and place it into the Teams message. Now the Teams message contains the error for the SSIS execution and each time this happens it probably saves the team member 4 or 5 minutes :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the code below, I&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>check if the failure comes from an SSIS instance&lt;br>
if($Inst -in ($SSISInstances)){&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Get the Execution ID from the Error message&lt;br>
&lt;code>$ExecutionId = [regex]::matches($BaseerrMessage, 'Execution ID: (\d{3,})').groups[1].value&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a query for the SSISDB&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$SSISQuery = @&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>SELECT * FROM catalog.event_messages em&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>WHERE em.operation_id = $ExecutionId&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>AND (em.event_name = 'OnError')&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>ORDER BY em.event_message_id;&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>&amp;quot;@&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set the Error Message and the Execution Path to variables&lt;br>
&lt;code>$errMessage = $SSISQueryResults.Message&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>$ExecutionPath = $SSISQueryResults.execution_path&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Get the Error Message for none SSIS failures&lt;br>
&lt;code>}else{&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>$errMessage = $j.group[-1].Message&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>$ExecutionPath = 'the job'&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>}&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create the Teams message&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You will see that I used &lt;code>SELECT *&lt;/code> because someone will always ask for some extra information in the future!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The topic for this months&lt;a class="link" href="https://nocolumnname.blog/2019/03/05/t-sql-tuesday-112-dipping-into-your-cookie-jar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
> T-SQL Tuesday #112&lt;/a> hosted by Shane O’Neill (&lt;a class="link" href="https://nocolumnname.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Blog&lt;/a> / &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sozdba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That is what I want from the contributors of this T-SQL Tuesday, those memories that they can think back on for sustenance. Like the humble cookie, I want a humble brag.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’m not good at bragging, &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>I’m generally convinced that all of you are better than me&lt;/a>. Yes, I am aware that it is irrational. This has made writing this post really hard. Sure, I get immense pleasure and satisfaction from solving a problem, that’s a form of instant fulfillment. Certainly, I enjoy teaching people and passing over my knowledge for them to use.&lt;br>
I am not going to write about technical things that I have done because they don’t give me sustenance in that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what does give me sustenance when times are hard?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The things I am most proud of are the things other people do where I have played a small part. These are the things I look back at and help to energise me. Things like&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A couple of people who I suggested started writing blogs and then speaking who are now seen as experts in their niche.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The people I mentored as new speakers who are now speaking all over the continent.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The most recent story was a DBA who sat in a full day pre-con at a SQL Saturday, took loads of notes and waited at the end to ask questions. We were looking at some code and she was telling me it wasn’t very good and apologising for it. It was good, it performed the required actions over a large estate and I told her so. I asked about her job and with a big sigh, she told a story of being stuck in a rut, dealing with a lot of legacy systems, not enjoying it and not being able to move on. We had a long talk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cut to this years SQL Bits and she came running up to me all energised. She has a new job, doing something “Cool in the cloud”, she said the things she had learned had helped her to land this role.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In all of these cases, it is the person involved who has done all of the hard work but it is these things that keep me going. The thank yous and the smiles I see on those peoples faces as they do the thing that they love and enjoy their success and progression 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cake-">Cake !!!!!&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Hey, thats cake and not cookies Rob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know. The biggest thing that keeps me going when times are tough though is the security I am able to provide. Nearly 20 years ago my life was very different. Without a job, I’d had to give up a career, struggling dealing with my wife’s serious illnesses, suddenly responsible for the entire household without the means to provide, I was in a very bleak place and saw no way out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So to have found a career that is my hobby, to be able to work and also to have fun, to have a social world that provides me with friends and entertainment in many countries and the opportunity to experience different cultures and still be able to live comfortably. Thats a blessing and what keeps me going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also being able to pay my dad back for turning up with sacks of potatoes by taking him to football matches and comedy shows 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Acknowledge what you have got, tell your loved ones that you love them, enjoy life and use your cookies when you need them but don’t forget the cake 🙂&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hitting the Wall – #TSQL2sDay</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/hitting-the-wall-#tsql2sday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/hitting-the-wall-#tsql2sday/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2018/08/farrel-nobel-97504-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Hitting the Wall – #TSQL2sDay" />&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2018/08/farrel-nobel-97504-unsplash.jpg"

&lt;p>Welcome to another edition of T-SQL Tuesday!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This T-SQL Tuesday is hosted by Wayne Sheffield ( &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>blog&lt;/a> | &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/DBAWayne" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>he has asked us to talk about&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[…]&lt;/em> a time when you ran up against your own brick wall, and how you worked it out or dealt with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="hitting-the-wall">Hitting The Wall&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When stuck in a problem in the past, I could often be found glued to a keyboard and screen for many hours. I would try this way and that way, I would Google and read Stack Overflow looking for ways around the particular issue I was seeing trying different things and finally I would get frustrated and fed up and stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe I would go and walk the dog, maybe just sit somewhere else but I would often find that I had an idea how to solve my problem and quickly go back to the keyboard frustrated that I hadnt thought about this earlier and frequently rinse and repeat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-different-way">A Different Way&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It took me many years to realise this and I wish I had done so sooner but once I made the connection that leaving the problem to one side for a little while meant that I often found a way to a solution for a problem I started setting a time limit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>30 minutes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I have been stuck on a problem for 30 minutes, I (mostly, I still sometimes fail at this) stop, take a break, go for a walk or do something different and the number of times that I arrive if not at a solution then at a path to a solution is remarkable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ask">Ask&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The other thing to do at this point in the troublesome problem solving is to ask. Twitter, Google, Slack, Stack Overflow. These are all excellent resources where you can quickly find people who are willing and capable of helping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t be like me and take years to work this out 🙂&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#tsql2sday – Giving Back – Reprise</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/#tsql2sday-giving-back-reprise/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/#tsql2sday-giving-back-reprise/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2017/08/tsql2sday.jpg" alt="Featured image of post #tsql2sday – Giving Back – Reprise" />&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://scribnasium.com/2018/05/giving-back-t-sql-tuesday-102-invite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s TSQL Tuesday again! This month our host is Riley Major (&lt;a class="link" href="https://scribnasium.com/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>b&lt;/a>/&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/RileyMajor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>t&lt;/a>) and the subject is &lt;em>Giving Back&lt;/em>. He’s given us two options here (as well as the side option of &lt;em>your favorite 2017 improvement&lt;/em>). Pick a way that you’d like to give back to the community and talk about it, or if you already give back,  tell us how and why you started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be a lot of excellent posts on this subject and one of the things that I like is that you can go to &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://tsqltuesday.com&lt;/a> and look up all of the entries which means that for a particular topic you can find a bunch of blog posts from different angles (I miss-typed that as angels first and yes they are all angels!) whether it is &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com/tag/career-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>career improvement&lt;/a> or technical like say &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com/tag/extended-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Extended Events&lt;/a> it is all there waiting for you 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote about &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tsql2sday-giving-back-some-examples-and-encouragement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>giving back in 2014&lt;/a> when I was about to help organise SQL Saturday Exeter for the first time. Last year I blogged about a &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tsql2sday-folks-who-have-made-a-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>few of the wonderful people&lt;/a> who made a difference to me. So this post is a little about how I give back and also hopefully some hints that can help you to do the same as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how">How&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are so many ways that you can give back to the community as Riley’s post shows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sharing your knowledge is a good way. I share my knowledge in blog posts and in sessions at user groups and at conferences. You can too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From beginner, introductory posts and talks to expert level deep dives every single one of us has learned from the blog posts that other people have spent their time and effort creating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>YOU can share your knowledge, even if you have only been using a technology for a few months, you have knowledge of the things you have learned and the things that would have made it easier. Write a post about those things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Answering questions is another way. You can do this on &lt;a class="link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stack Overflow,&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Server Central&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="http://PowerShell.Org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PowerShell.Org&lt;/a> , Reddit, Facebook , on &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SQLHelp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Twitter using the #sqlhelp&lt;/a> or #PowerShellHelp or just in person. I try to answer questions when I see them on twitter or in the &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlps.io/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Community Slack&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mentoring or just providing feedback to people. You can offer to proof read blog posts or abstract submissions or you can listen to peoples presentations. I do this and it is a lot of fun&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also share my knowledge via &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqldbawithabeard" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my GitHub&lt;/a>. All of my &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>presentations slides and code&lt;/a> are available as well as other code that I use. I also contribute to open-source projects such as &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dbatools&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbachecks.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dbachecks&lt;/a>.  You can do this too. You could open an issue for an improvement or bug. You can contribute your code, even if you are not confident writing the code you can fix spelling mistakes or add documentation., everything helps&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can help with organisation of events. I have helped to organise the PowerShell Europe Conference, PSDay.UK, SQL Saturday Exeter, SQL SouthWest user group, PASS PowerShell Virtual Group. I have also helped with session choices for a number of other events like &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlgrillen.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Grillen&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlgla.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQLGLA&lt;/a> and I have volunteered at many events from SQL Saturdays to SQL Bits. Everything from setting up and tearing down (IE moving heavy things and cleaning up rubbish) to sitting on the information desk, giving out badges, making sure the speakers are on time in their sessions. You can do this too. Just ask the organisers of the events what they need. It is better to do this prior to the event than on the day but I am sure all help is welcomed. &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sql_unicorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Richard Munn&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event17/Advice_and_guidance_on_becoming_a_speaker_or_volunteer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>I talked (waffled?) about this at SQL Bits this year&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to be considered as a volunteer for next years SQL Bits please email helpers at sqlbits.com&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So why did I start giving back?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to be useful. I saw the amount of work that Jonathan and Annette were doing organising SQL Saturday Exeter and SQL South West. I hoped that I could help them with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I carry on doing it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because it is fun 🙂 I enjoy speaking, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and talking to people&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is good but there is more to it as well&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You learn so much by writing a presentation or a blog post because you will do research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will learn even more when people ask you questions in your sessions or leave comments on your blog posts and you have to go and find the answers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You learn new and useful skills and demonstrate your knowledge to potential employers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My blog is a scrapbook of knowledge that I go back to and use all the time (and sometimes I forget that I have written something and find my own post in the search results!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the most important reason is that I feel that it pays back some of the benefit that I have gained from all of those people who’s time and effort I made use of for free when I was learning and continue to do so to this day. All of those blog posts and videos and presentations that I consumed have helped to make me the technician I am today. I have skills and abilities that I would not have without them all and by giving back I hope that I am enabling others to develop and see the benefit of sharing so that they will continue to do so in the future and I can learn from them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TSQL2sDay – Get-PostRoundup</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/tsql2sday-get-postroundup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/tsql2sday-get-postroundup/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --></description></item><item><title>#TSQL2sDay – Starting Out with PowerShell</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/#tsql2sday-starting-out-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/#tsql2sday-starting-out-with-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --></description></item><item><title>TSQL2sday #94 Lets get all Posh!</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/tsql2sday-#94-lets-get-all-posh/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/tsql2sday-#94-lets-get-all-posh/</guid><description>&lt;p>Write-Output &amp;ldquo;What are you going to automate today?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

It is no surprise to those that know me that I will choose PowerShell as the topic for this month. I am passionate about PowerShell because it has enabled me to have the career I have today and to visit numerous countries all around the world, meet people and talk about PowerShell. By my reckoning &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com/?s=PowerShell" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>searching the TSQL Tuesday website&lt;/a> it has been over 3 years since we had a topic specific to PowerShell. So I would like you to blog about PowerShell and SQL Server (or other interesting data platform products)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know or use PowerShell GREAT! That&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please spend an hour or so with it and tell us how you got on and what and how you learned. Just like &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2017/07/live-blogging-erik-vs-PowerShell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Erik and Brent did&lt;/a>. You could install one of the community modules like &lt;a class="link" href="https://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>This will be of so much benefit to all people who don&amp;rsquo;t use PowerShell and want to start to learn about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do use PowerShell and SQL then either tell the tale of the best thing you have automated or a beginners post to show people how to start using PowerShell. I have heard many stories and am looking forward to tales of&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>testing backups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>doing migrations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>resetting log shipping&lt;/li>
&lt;li>creating things in the cloud and on premises&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SQL on Linux with PowerShell on Linux&lt;/li>
&lt;li>using Pester for testing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>automating manual tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>automating incident knowledge gathering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>continuous integration and delivery&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>and many more. I will read all of them and do a write up of them later next week.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This month’s &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>T-SQL Tuesday&lt;/a> is hosted by &lt;a class="link" href="https://littlekendra.com/2017/08/01/tsql-tuesday-93-interviewing-patterns-anti-patterns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Kendra Little and is on the topic of interviews &lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hate interviews as an interviewee. I have had many memorable experiences with them. Even writing this blog post has been challenging as I relive some of them. I haven’t shared a lot of the worst ones!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-i-was-a-lad">When I was a lad&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My first interview was for a waiter/washer up at a local country pub aged 15 or so. I stumbled and stammered and stuttered my way through and I think it was only because they needed someone that evening that I got the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was 17 I wanted a car and whilst doing my A-Levels I got a job at a local private school to achieve this. It was about a 10 minute cycle from my college to the school and I was so nervous that about half-way I was incapable of riding my bike and had to walk. I then was faced with two people interviewing me which I was not expecting or prepared for. I remember nothing of the interview other than leaving it soaking in sweat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nerves">Nerves&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a young man I interviewed for numerous jobs and things got progressively worse for me. I would get so incredibly nervous. I could not sleep or eat before an interview. This meant I often was feeling very nauseous and tired during an interview. I would arrive incredibly early and have to waste time wandering around, giving me more time to think about how nervous I was and, of course, making it worse. Obviously I wouldn’t give a good impression and didn’t get the jobs which meant more interviews and more nerves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried many things, I sought advice and information from many sources and approached the situation in a number of different ways without much change to my internal responses.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparation-practice-knowledge-and-distraction">Preparation, Practice, Knowledge and Distraction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To this day I hate interviews even after 20 years of having to do them. I can still get so overcome by nerves that I forget even the simplest and most obvious things such as what the N in DNS stands for or what the question is that I should be answering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To minimise this, I try my best to prepare as well as I possibly can. I learn and revise the things I think I will need to show that I know by reading the job descriptions and adverts carefully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also split the whole process into separate boxes. Revising and researching a company and a job was one part. Getting ready and travelling and arriving was another and the actual interview was then just the last part consisting of talking to some people. This definitely reduced the overall stress and improved my performance in interviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A previous shop provided interviewer training and needed volunteers to be interviewed for those courses. I volunteered as often as I was able to and treated them as realistically as was feasible. This helped me a lot and also enabled me (sometimes) to view an interview as just a chat. If you suffer with nerves and this is available I would recommend doing so. If not, ask someone who interviews for some practice interviews and treat them as realistically as you feel is necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A wise person told me to remember that interviewers are people too and also that good interviewers will recognise nerves and assist the interviewee. After all, they are trying to find the right person to fulfil their needs and want to know if you meet their requirements for that position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another wise person told me, during an interview, that it was ok to ask for clarification about a question. A decade or more of interviews before I knew that. It enables me to pull back from a spiral of nerves making me gabble and to be able to return to the question required. When I find that I am rambling in my answer or that the answer has disappeared from my mind I ask the interviewer for clarification and get some much needed breathing space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reduce the impact of nervousness before the interview I learnt to distract myself in the couple of hours prior to an interview. I have been known to go and see a film if a cinema is close to the interview or do the weekly shopping. Anything that can occupy my mind without risking me being late. This may be of no use to many people but it works for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-other-side-of-the-table">The other side of the table&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As an interviewer, I hope that I recognise when people are nervous and am able to assist them and also coax out the information that I need to be able to make the best decision about the candidate for the position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interviewing is tiring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I worked in &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital#Secure_units" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>secure units&lt;/a> we would sometimes spend 2 continuous days interviewing. It is hard work. You need to look after yourself in these situations. It is important to drink plenty of water, to ensure that you eat and at least get up and stretch in between interviews. The very last person you interview might be the perfect candidate don’t miss that because you have switched off.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-are-being-interviewed-too">You are being interviewed too&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The person that you are interviewing is also interviewing you. They are considering if they want to come and work for your company with the people they meet. That might only be the people in the interview so it is important I think to ensure that you make a good impression as well. During a day of interviewing many candidates try to reset before each person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being courteous, attentive and professional is important during the interview even if the interviewers recognise that the person is not suitable for that role within 2 minutes. They may be ideal for another position or you may come across them later in your career. Leave a good impression.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparation">Preparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A shop I worked at employed a new DBA who had impressed the manager in interview with their knowledge as they had passed a lot of exams. The manager was very pleased and looking forward to the new arrival. This changed quite quickly when it became obvious that the new DBA was missing some basic knowledge about installing SQL Server and creating new databases which was a significant part of their role. A lot of time was wasted by the other DBAs in the team re-doing and re-checking the work that this person had done and team dynamics went downhill very quickly (although I did learn a lot about Policy Based Management from this experience!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was working in secure units focusing on people with Autism we knew that communication skills both verbal and non-verbal were vital to all members of our team. We had an excellent set of questions and scenarios early in the interview to establish peoples capabilities in these areas and this allowed us to close off interviews early when we could see that the candidate did not meet our requirements as well as ensuring we employed people with the right skills for a very challenging workplace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the interviews for a replacement DBA the manager asked how to avoid a repeat of that situation. I described the situation above and as a team we identified the basic skills, knowledge and approaches that we wanted in our future team members and designed a set of questions and scenarios so that candidates could demonstrate them. This was excellent for ensuring the entire team felt that they had some input into the recruiting process and also added confidence in the new team member. I think it was an excellent piece of team management as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest take away from this post, I hope, is preparation. For both sides of the table preparation is a vital part of any interview process. Also if you see me all dressed up and in the queue for a film I am probably very nervous and won’t want to chat!!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="i-think-you-should-share-what-you-know-with-others">I think you should share what you know with others.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will be amazing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will give you some great advice I learnt from a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/08/become-presenter-change-your-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>blog post&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Start speaking&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep going&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Listen to feedback&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That’s it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Kendra has said it all, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to read any further ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>However..&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="not-all-plain-sailing">Not all plain sailing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I love giving sessions but I never knew or thought that I would. My journey to speaking started at my SQL user group in Exeter and two fabulous people &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/FatherJack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jonathan&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Mrs_FatherJack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Annette Allen&lt;/a> who encouraged me to share some PowerShell with the group. I was terrified, didn&amp;rsquo;t think I was worthy, my HDMI output wasn&amp;rsquo;t strong enough to power the projector, I had to transfer my slides and demo to Jonathans laptop. It was a fraught and frustrating experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My second presentation was done on &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/napalmgram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stuart Moores&lt;/a> MacBook Pro using Office Online for presentations and Azure for demos. Again a change right at the last minute and using a machine I didn&amp;rsquo;t know (and a different keyboard set-up).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stuff will go wrong. Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law will always show his head somewhere and no matter how often you test and re-test your demos, sometimes an odd thing will make them stop working&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be problems and issues, you can mitigate some of them by following the 6 P&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Proper Preparation Prevents Pretty Poor Performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You can read some great blog posts in this T-SQL Tuesday Series and also &lt;a class="link" href="https://voiceofthedba.wordpress.com/2016/10/13/why-i-practice-presentations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="you-never-know-you-might-enjoy-it">You never know you might enjoy it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I found I enjoyed it and wanted to do more and since then I have presented sessions in a wide variety of places. It was very strange to have been sat watching and listening to all of these fantastic presenters thinking I could never do that and then find out that actually it is something that I enjoy doing and find fun. You can do that too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equally, it&amp;rsquo;s ok to not enjoy it, think its not worth the stress and hassle and support the community in a different way but at least give it a go&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-will-be-nervous">You will be nervous&lt;/h2>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shared a train across Germany with someone who had attended the PSMonday conference in Munich and they were astonished when I said that I get very nervous before speaking. It&amp;rsquo;s ok to be nervous, the trick is to make use of that nervous energy and turn it into something positive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get very nervous before presentations. My hands shake, I sweat, I either babble or loose my voice. I fret and fidget and check everything a thousandillion times. I find it is better for me if I am sat in the room during the previous presentation as that generally helps me to feel more relaxed as I can listen to their talk and also out of respect for the presenter and the organisation it forces me to sit quietly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will find your own way to deal with this, maybe listening to music on headphones or just sitting quietly somewhere. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it is not immediately obvious, try some different things, talk with others and believe me, it will be ok.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t try to numb it with alcohol&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I get up and its &amp;lsquo;my&amp;rsquo; turn I take a few deep breaths and suddenly presenter turns on and I forget all about being nervous.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="something-to-talk-about">Something to talk about&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have nothing to talk about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or everyone else knows more than I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or X Y and Z talk about this much better than I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m scared&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/splappy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Richard Munn&lt;/a> and I gave an impromptu session at SQL Relay in Cardiff where we talked about and hopefully encouraged people to start speaking and these statements came up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/images/wp_20161004_13_59_32_pro.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="wp_20161004_13_59_32_pro"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heres (a little of) what we said&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No-one knows everything. Many people know a hell of a lot but not everything. You know a lot more than you realise and you also know things that no-one else does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are stuck for things to talk about think about the you of 6 months or a year ago and something that you have learnt in that time and write the session that you wish you could have seen then. There will be other people at a similar stage who will appreciate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t be scared, they are only people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="practice">Practice&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My dog is the one person who has been present at my presentations the most. He has listened (sometimes intently) to me practicing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to practice speaking out loud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to understand the timings&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to be comfortable with hearing yourself speaking out aloud&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to practice speaking out loud&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A double reminder because I think it is important. You should practice and practice and practice with an eye on your timings and if you have a good friend who is technical or a small group at work for a lunchtime maybe then ask them if they will listen and give feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wanna-chat">Wanna chat?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am very passionate about community involvement and lucky enough to be involved in two fantastic communities - the SQL community and the PowerShell community and have made some great friends along the way. I was amazed and proud when very soon after my second presentation someone told me that I had inspired them to start to present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then I have gone out of my way to encourage other people to speak and to blog and am really enjoying watching them blossom. If you want to have a chat via email or via &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlps.io/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>slack&lt;/a> about speaking or blogging or getting involved in the community please feel free to contact me and I promise you I will get back to you. Better still go to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlps.io/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Community Slack&lt;/a> and ask questions in #presentingorspeaking&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="go-find-out-more">Go find out more&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are good at sharing and learning technical content but we can share and learn about so much more, about all aspects of our life. Go and read all of the other posts in this T-SQL Tuesday for starters :-) and develop&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enterprise Strategies - A #TSQL2sDay post</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/enterprise-strategies-a-#tsql2sday-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/enterprise-strategies-a-#tsql2sday-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2015/09/time-for-t-sql-tuesday-70/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>This months TSQL2sDay blog post party is hosted by &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2015/09/time-for-t-sql-tuesday-70/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jen McCown&lt;/a> and is about Enterprise Strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adam Mechanic started &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/archive/2009/11/30/invitation-to-participate-in-t-sql-tuesday-001-date-time-tricks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>you search for them&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managing SQL servers at enterprise scale is not a straightforward task. Your aim as a DBA should be to simplify it as much as possible and to automate everything that you possibly can. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.johnsansom.com/the-best-database-administrators-automate-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>This post by John Sansom&lt;/a> could have been written for this months party and I recommend that you read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here are a few points that I think you should consider if you look after SQL in an Enterprise environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Enterprise Strategy will undoubtedly garner a whole host of excellent posts and Jen will provide a round up post which will I am certain will be an excellent resource. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2015/09/the-tsql2sday-70-roundup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Take a look here&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Know where your instances are and have a single place that you can reference them from. Some people recommend a &lt;a class="link" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb895144.aspx?f=255&amp;amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Central Management Server&lt;/a> but I find this too restrictive for my needs. I use an InstanceList table in my DBA Database with the following columns [ServerName], [InstanceName] , [Port] , [AG] , [Inactive] , [Environment] and [Location]. This enables me to target instances not just by name but by environment (Dev, Test, Pre-Prod, Live etc), by location or by joining the InstanceList table with another table I can target by the application or any number of other factors. I also capture information about the servers at windows and SQL level to this database so I can target the SQL 2012 servers specifically if need be or any other metric. This is very powerful and enables far greater flexibility than the CMS in my opinion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use PowerShell (no surprise I would mention this!) PowerShell is a brilliant tool for automation and I use it all of the time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get used to using this piece of PowerShell code&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Notice the query variable above, this is where the power lies as it enables you to gather all the instances that you need for your task as described in the bullet post above. Once you get used to doing this you can do things like this identify all the instances with Remote DAC disabled using a query against the DBA Database and then enable it on all servers by adding this code to the loop above&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2

&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$srv.RemoteDacEnabled = $true
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$srv.alter()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Very quick very simple and very very powerful. You can also use this to run TSQL scripts against the instances you target but there are some &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=issues%20with%20invoke-sqlcmd&amp;amp;form=EDGEAR&amp;amp;qs=PF&amp;amp;cvid=bafe07c6afd54a6cb0ce7a1583300a79&amp;amp;pq=issues%20with%20invoke-sqlcmd&amp;amp;elv=AF!A!XC!KoOyC2FxnVd!deIwlgRcylR4EqUAG2rfVDNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>added complications with Invoke-SQLCmd&lt;/a> that you need to be aware of&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>BE CAREFUL. Test and understand and test before you run any script on a live system especially using a script like this which enables you to target ALL of your servers. You must definitely check that your $ServerNames array contains only the instances you need before you make any changes. You need to be ultra-cautious when it is possible to do great damage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write scripts that are robust and handle errors gracefully. I use Jason Wasser @wasserja Write-Log function to write to a text file and wrap my commands in a try catch block.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Include comments in your scripts to assist either the future you or the folks in your position in 5 years time. I would also add one of my bug bears - Use the description block in Agent Jobs. The first place any DBA is going to go to when that job fails is to open the properties of the job. Please fill in that block so that anyone troubleshooting knows some information about what the job does or at the very least a link to some documentation about it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally in my list, don&amp;rsquo;t overdo the alerts. Alerting is vital for any DBA it is a brilliant way to ensure that you quickly know about any issues affecting your estate but &lt;a class="link" href="http://thomaslarock.com/2012/02/the-minimalist-guide-to-database-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>all alerts should be actionable&lt;/a> and in some cases you can automate the action that you can take but the message here is don&amp;rsquo;t send messages to the DBA team email for every single tiny thing or they will get swamped and ignore the vital one. This holds for whichever alerting or monitoring system that you use&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is but a small sub-section of things that you need to consider when responsible for a large SQL estate but if you need help and advice or just moral support and you don’t already interact with the SQL community then make today the day you start.

&lt;p>I love being a part of the SQL community. It gives me the opportunity to learn as much as I want to about anything I can think of within the data field. In the last couple of months I have presented at &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlne.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Newcastle User Group&lt;/a> and learnt about migrating SQL using Powershell with &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/napalmgram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Mickey Stuewe&lt;/a> and that’s only the ‘in-person’ learning that I did. I also read a lot of blog posts!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But instead of repeating what I learnt from others within the community I thought I would write a blog post that I have been meaning to write for a few weeks about a solution pre-built into Windows that appears to not be well known. Problem Step Recorder.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-psr">What is PSR?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I found out about a little known tool included in Windows Operating System a couple of months ago which enables you to record what you are doing by taking screenshots of every mouse click. The tool is Step Recorder also known as PSR. It is included by default in Windows 7 , Windows 8 and 8.1 and Windows Server 2008 and above.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Simply put, it records “This is what I did” There are many situations when this can be useful&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can use this during installations to help create documentation. “This is what I did” when I installed X and now you can follow those steps and I know I haven’t missed anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can use it when communicating with 3rd parties or other support teams. “This is what I did” when I got this error and here are all of the steps so that you can re-create the issue and I know that I haven’t missed anything&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can use this when resolving high priority incidents. “This is what I did” when System X broke, it includes all of the times of my actions.&lt;br>
I still keep my notepad by my keyboard out of habit but I have a record of the exact steps that I took to try to resolve the issue which will be very useful for reporting on the incident in the near future and also placing into a Knowledge Base for others to use if it happens again and I know I haven’t missed anything&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For assisting family members. Like many, I am “The IT guy” and PSR enables me to provide clear instructions with pictures showing exactly where I clicked to those family members who are having trouble with “The internet being broken”&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It does this by automatically taking a screen shot after every mouse click or program event with a timestamp and a description of what happened. It does not record keystrokes though so if you need to record what you have typed there is some manual steps required&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="so-how-do-you-access-psr">So how do you access PSR?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Simple. Type “psr” into the run box, cmd or PowerShell and it will open&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2014/11/untitled-picture.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2014/11/untitled-picture.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Untitled picture"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you click on Start Record it will start recording your clicks and taking screenshots. However I always open the settings by clicking on the drop down to the left of the help icon first and change the number of recent screen captures to store to the maximum value of 100.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2014/11/1untitled-picture.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="1Untitled picture"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do not you will get no warning but PSR will only save the last 25 screenshots it takes and your results will look like the below. It will still record your actions but not keep the screenshots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tsql2sday-60-something-new-learned-problem-step-recorder/%24Recording_20141109_1348.mht" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Step 18: (09/11/2014 13:47:47) User left click on “T-SQL Tuesday #60 – Something New Learned | The SQL Professor (text)” in “T-SQL Tuesday #60 – Something New Learned | The SQL Professor – Google Chrome”&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also set the name and location of the saved file in the settings but if you leave it blank it will prompt for a location and name once you click Stop Record&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-add-keyboard-input">How do I add keyboard input?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>PSR allows you add keyboard input manually. You may need this if you need to include the text you have entered into prompts or address bars or if you wish to add further comment. You can do this by clicking add comment, drawing a box around the relevant part of the screen for the text input and inputting the text into the box&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allows you to review what PSR has recorded. You can then save it to a location of your desire. It is saved as a zip file which has a single .mht file in it. You can open the file without unzipping the archive and it will open in Internet Explorer. As you can see from the shots below you can run PSR on your client and it will still record actions in your RDP sessions although it does not record as much detail. The first two are on my SCOM server in my lab and the second two are on the laptop using the SCOM console&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can then use the zip file as you wish. Maybe you email it to your third party support team (once you have edited any confidential data) or you can attach it to your incident in your IT Service Management solution or attach it to a report. If you wish to create documentation you can open the .mht file in Word, edit it as you see fit and save it appropriately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that is one of the many things that I have learnt recently and I am looking forward to seeing what others have learnt especially as many will have just been to the SQL PASS Summit.

>who said&lt;/a> This month’s topic is all about the cloud. What’s your take on it? Have you used it? If so, let’s hear your experiences. Haven’t used it? Let’s hear why or why not? Do you like/dislike recent changes made to cloud services? It’s clear skies for writing! So let’s hear it folks, where do you stand with the cloud?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My wife would tell you that my head is always in the cloud and she’s right (she usually is) just not like that picture! I would love to float gracefully above the land and gaze upon the view but its the landing that bothers me and will always stop me from trying it&lt;/p>

&lt;p>She’s right, pedantically and literally too, because this year I have spent a lot of time with my head and my fingers and my thinking in &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.windowsazure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Virtual Machines using Windows Azure&lt;/a>. That is where I have learnt a lot of my SQL and Powershell this year. After &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlsouthwest.co.uk/sqlsat269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Saturday Exeter&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/12-things-i-learnt-at-sqlbits-xi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Bits in Nottingham&lt;/a> this year I have needed a place to practice and learn, an environment to try things and break things and mend them again and experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I learn just as well by doing things as I do reading about them. Stuart Moore  &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/napalmgram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@napalmgram&lt;/a> has a great post called &lt;a class="link" href="http://stuart-moore.com/learning-play-sql-server/" title="http://stuart-moore.com/learning-play-sql-server/"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Learning to Play with SQL Server&lt;/a> and whist I haven’t been as rough with my Azure SQL instances as he suggests I have been able to practice at will without worry and thanks to my MSDN subscription without cost. I have taken examples from blog posts and demos from User Group Sessions and run them on my Windows Azure VMs&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every single blog post I have written this year that has examples has been written in Azure and screen shots from Azure. Whilst some of my Powershell scripts in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#box-of-tricks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PowerShell Box of Tricks&lt;/a> series had already been written to solve one particular problem or another at MyWork, every single one was refined and demo’d and all the screen shots were from Azure and several were developed on Azure too&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first ever session to the SQL South West user group was about &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/spinning-up-and-shutting-down-windows-azure-lab-with-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Spinning up and Shutting Down VMS in Azure&lt;/a> was about Azure and was an interesting experience in &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Murphys Law&lt;/a> which meant I &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/lessons-learnt-from-my-first-talk-at-sql-southwest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ended up having to deliver it  on Azure&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second time I have talked was about the PowerShell Box of Tricks series to the Cardiff User Group. Having learnt my lesson from the first time I had bought a mini HDMI to VGA converter and I had tested it using a couple of monitors at home and it worked wonderfully. However, when I got to Cardiff my little Asus convertible didn’t provide enough grunt to power the funky presentation screen. Luckily thanks to Stuart Moore &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/napalmgram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@napalmgram&lt;/a> who was also there doing his &lt;a class="link" href="http://stuart-moore.com/category/31-days-of-sql-server-backup-and-restore-with-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>excellent PowerShell Back Up and Restore Sessio&lt;/a>n who let me use his Mac I was able to deliver the session using Office Web App to run the PowerPoint from my SkyDrive whilst all the demos were on ………Yup you guessed it Windows Azure !!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I feel qualified to answer Jorge’s questions and take part in T-SQL Tuesday this time round.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like Azure. I like the ease I can spin up and down machines or any PaaS services at will. I love that I can do it with PowerShell because I really enjoy using PowerShell in my day to day work and at home too. Living as I do in a beautifully convenient bungalow in the country, I still enjoy the frustration of watching that spinning ring as my videos buffer on our 1.8Mbs at best internet connection. Whilst that does have an impact on using Azure it is a damn sight better than waiting many days trying to download one single file. Something like an ISO file for the latest SQL Server CTP for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no way I would have got a look at SQL Server 2014 if it wasn’t for Azure. I was able to spin up a SQL Server 2014 machine in only a few minutes and log in and have a play and then delete it. I have done the same with Server 2012 and 2012 R2. It has enabled me to try setting up Availability Groups and other technologies not yet implemented at MyWork&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wouldn’t have been able to do any of that on my machines at home as I don’t have anything capable of running Hyper-V whilst this 8 year old desktop still keeps hanging on despite the odd noises. (Negotiations are currently in place to replace it with something shiny and new. &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/?p=513" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Just need that lottery win now !!)&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have also transferred my Cricket Averages database to WASD and am talking with a friend of mine about developing an app that will use the mobile service as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rate of change is much quicker in the cloud, things change and change quickly. As quickly as I had written my post about &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/spinning-up-and-shutting-down-windows-azure-lab-with-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Spinning up and Shutting Down VMS in Azure&lt;/a> Microsoft changed the rules and didn’t charge for machines that were turned off. New services appear all the time. New services move quickly through from Preview to release and as &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.scarydba.com/2013/11/05/more-azure-goodies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Grant Fritchey noticed this week&lt;/a> new views have been added to to Windows Azure SQL Database under the covers. I think this is something we are just going to have to live with. The scale of the cloud means it is much easier to test improvements at large scale and that means they can be released quicker.  It makes it more challenging to keep up I admit but it’s a constant drip of new things rather than a big bang all at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure has brought me to where I am today and I think it will continue to be part of my future. If I remember to submit my PowerShell session for SQL Saturday Exeter (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/269/callforspeakers.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Submit yours here&lt;/a>) and it gets chosen then you will be able to see me there &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>(if you register here&lt;/a>) using Azure to give back to the SQL Community&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
