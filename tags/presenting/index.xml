&lt;h1 id="it-depends">It depends&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The best answer is always &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo; and the correct response to this to determine how much to trust this information is &amp;ldquo;what does it depend uponW&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-does-it-depend-upon">what does it depend upon?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It depends upon which programme you are using and wish to demonstrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="visual-studio-code-or-azure-data-studio">Visual Studio Code or Azure Data Studio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are using &lt;a class="link" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5002693" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Azure Data Studio&lt;/a> then you have it built in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can press &lt;code>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/code> and search for screencast&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/screencast.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/screencast.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="screencast"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if you toggle this on then the keystrokes are displayed on the screen as you type&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/display.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/display.png"

alt="displaying the keystrokes"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you &lt;code>CTRL+,&lt;/code> or click on the cog and then settings, you can search for screencast and there are a number of options available. In the screenshot below you can see that the mouse click is highlighted as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="something-else">Something else&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are wanting to demonstrate in a different application or when switching applications, you can use Carnac - &lt;a class="link" href="http://carnackeys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://carnackeys.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download the latest release and then run setup.exe and there will be a beautiful purple icon in the taskbar which if you click it will open the settings screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/carnacsettings.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/carnacsettings.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="carnac settings"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can click in any of the squares to decide where you would like the key presses to be displayed and as you can see it works with multiple monitors (although I had some issues with that). You can use the sliders to offset in any direction from the box as well and change the appearance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can even change the colour of the text as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/carnacdisplays.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/carnacdisplays.png"

&lt;p>As with many things in my life it started with a tweet&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sammydeprez/status/1307674009669074945" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

alt="Twitter"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That looks awesome, I thought, so I watched the YouTube video.Scott has written a C# application that would change the scene depending on some text in the PowerPoint slide notes. Then, by applying a Chroma filter to the display capture and placing the webcam capture appropriately, when the slide changed, the Obs scene changed and the webcam became embedded in the slide!!!!!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>It is truly awesome but it is for Obs and I use StreamLabs and I wondered if it could be done with PowerShell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(If you just want the code, &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Functions/blob/master/PowerPointSlobs.ps1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>you can find it here&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="listen-to-powerpoint-events-with-powershell">Listen to PowerPoint Events with PowerShell&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="create-a-com-object">Create a Com Object&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first thing that we need to do is to find out when the PowerPoint Slide has changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can create a PowerPoint Com Object with&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$Application = New-Object -ComObject PowerPoint.Application
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>and make it visible with&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$Application.Visible = 'MsoTrue'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="get-the-slide-number-and-notes">Get the Slide Number and Notes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Next step is to get the slide number. It is not truly required for the code, but I like to print it out so that I know which slide I was on for trouble shooting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/shanselman/PowerPointToOBSSceneSwitcher/blob/accf2c40d0f1cbb31287751bd7be4ae2fe0d3bb7/Program.cs#L34" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Scotts code here&lt;/a> I worked out that the slide number via PowerShell was&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$slideNumber = $PowerPoint.SlideShowWindows[1].view.Slide.SlideIndex
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The notes (by looking at &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/shanselman/PowerPointToOBSSceneSwitcher/blob/accf2c40d0f1cbb31287751bd7be4ae2fe0d3bb7/Program.cs#L37" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>code&lt;/a>) can be accessed at&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$notes = $PowerPoint.SlideShowWindows[1].View.Slide.NotesPage.Shapes[2].TextFrame.TextRange.Text
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>then parse the notes to get the scene name which is defined as &lt;code>OBS:SceneName&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$SceneName = ($notes -split &amp;quot;`r&amp;quot;)[0] -replace 'OBS:', ''
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The first part gets the first line and it was thanks to Andreas on twitch who got this working, Thank you Andreas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="listen-to-an-event">Listen to an Event&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With PowerShell, you can subscribes to events and take action when they fire. The event that we are going to subscribe to is called &lt;code>SlideShowNextSlide&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$subscriber = Register-ObjectEvent -InputObject $PowerPoint -EventName SlideShowNextSlide -Action $action
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We have defined an $action variable in the code but we need to provide an action and this is where things got a little tricky.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automating-streamlabs-obs">Automating StreamLabs OBS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In Scotts code he uses OBS.WebSocket.NET to control OBS. Excellent, PowerShell and .NET.Unfrotunately, StreamLabs uses an RPC-based API &lt;a class="link" href="https://stream-labs.github.io/streamlabs-obs-api-docs/docs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://stream-labs.github.io/streamlabs-obs-api-docs/docs/index.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This documentation specifies&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can access services&amp;rsquo; methods and properties by sending JSON-RPC messages to the named pipe slobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="thank-you-keith-hill">Thank you Keith Hill&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So Rob traversed a rabbit warren of investigation to understand how to send messages to this API with PowerShell and eventually stumbled across the marvelous Keith Hill &lt;a class="link" href="https://rkeithhill.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>blog&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/r_keith_hill" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>twitter&lt;/a> and a blog post from 2014&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://rkeithhill.wordpress.com/2014/11/01/windows-powershell-and-named-pipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://rkeithhill.wordpress.com/2014/11/01/windows-powershell-and-named-pipes/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="create-a-connection-and-send-and-receive-messages">Create a connection and send and receive messages&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now I had everything I needed to create a connection to SLOBS via named pipes. SLOBS needs to be started here!&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># Create Client
$npipeClient = New-Object System.IO.Pipes.NamedPipeClientStream($Env:ComputerName, 'slobs', [System.IO.Pipes.PipeDirection]::InOut, [System.IO.Pipes.PipeOptions]::None, [System.Security.Principal.TokenImpersonationLevel]::Impersonation)
$npipeClient.Connect()
$npipeClient
# Create Reader and writer and send and receive message
$pipeReader = New-Object System.IO.StreamReader($npipeClient)
$pipeWriter = New-Object System.IO.StreamWriter($npipeClient)
$pipeWriter.AutoFlush = $true
# Send message
$pipeWriter.WriteLine($scenesMessage)
# Receive message
$pipeReader.ReadLine()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="which-messages">Which messages?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Next I needed to get the messages to send formatted correctly. Looking at the &lt;a class="link" href="https://stream-labs.github.io/streamlabs-obs-api-docs/docs/index.html#examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>API docs&lt;/a> I saw&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{
&amp;quot;jsonrpc&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2.0&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 1,
&amp;quot;method&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;getScenes&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;params&amp;quot;: {
&amp;quot;resource&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ScenesService&amp;quot;
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>So I was able to get the current available scenes with&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$scenesMessage = '{&amp;quot;jsonrpc&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2.0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 6,&amp;quot;method&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;getScenes&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;params&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;resource&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ScenesService&amp;quot;}}'
$pipeWriter.WriteLine($scenesMessage)
($pipeReader.ReadLine() | ConvertFrom-Json).result | Select Name, id
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2020/09/getslobsscenes.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Get SLOBS Scenes"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="change-scenes">Change Scenes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The last part of the jigsaw was to change the scene via the named pipe connection&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$scenesMessage = '{&amp;quot;jsonrpc&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2.0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 6,&amp;quot;method&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;getScenes&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;params&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;resource&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ScenesService&amp;quot;}}'
$pipeWriter.WriteLine($scenesMessage)
$scenes = ($pipeReader.ReadLine() | ConvertFrom-Json).result | Select Name, id
$SceneId = ($scenes | Where Name -eq $SceneName).id
$MakeSceneActiveMessage = '{ &amp;quot;jsonrpc&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2.0&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;method&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;makeSceneActive&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;params&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;resource&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ScenesService&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;args&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;' + $SceneId + '&amp;quot;]}}'
$pipeWriter.WriteLine($MakeSceneActiveMessage)
$switchResults = $pipeReader.ReadLine() | ConvertFrom-Json
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Which looks like this :-)&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="setting-up-powerpoint-and-scenes">Setting up PowerPoint and Scenes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With the PowerShell set up, we next need to set it up to use the scenes. I followed Scotts example and used &lt;code>OBS:SceneName&lt;/code> as the reference to the Scene. I added this to the first line of the notes on a slide&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2020/09/pptxnotes.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Slide Notes"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and then created a text box with a green fill&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2020/09/greenbox.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Green Box"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In StreamLabs, I set up the scene with the same name, the order of the sources is important. They are displayed from top to bottom, front to back so the Display Capture will be on top of the Sony Camera here&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2020/09/sourceorder.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Source order"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I right clicked on the Display Capture and chose Filters&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2020/09/choosefilters.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="choose filters"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and chose a Chroma Key filter&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the PowerPoint in SlideShow mode, I set the Chroma Key filter colour to match the colour of the green box, placed the camera source in the correct location and saved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The image below shows form left to right, the Chroma Key settings, the scene in SLOBS and the PowerPoint slideshow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2020/09/setfilter.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="set filters"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally, I would do this on seperate screens of course!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I set up each slide like this and then I closed the PowerPoint and ran the code, &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Functions/blob/master/PowerPointSlobs.ps1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>you can find it here,&lt;/a>)leaving PowerShell running in the background. This opened PowerPoint and I opened the deck and started the slide show and as I navigate through the slide, the scene changes and so does the webcam position :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see a test run below&lt;/p>

>SQL Server Community Slack&lt;/a> for presenting which everyone can make use of to ask and to answer questions&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-think-you-should-share-what-you-know-with-others">I think you should share what you know with others.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will be amazing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will give you some great advice I learnt from a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/08/become-presenter-change-your-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Start speaking&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep going&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Listen to feedback&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That’s it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Kendra has said it all, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to read any further ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>However..&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="not-all-plain-sailing">Not all plain sailing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I love giving sessions but I never knew or thought that I would. My journey to speaking started at my SQL user group in Exeter and two fabulous people &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/FatherJack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jonathan&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Mrs_FatherJack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Annette Allen&lt;/a> who encouraged me to share some PowerShell with the group. I was terrified, didn&amp;rsquo;t think I was worthy, my HDMI output wasn&amp;rsquo;t strong enough to power the projector, I had to transfer my slides and demo to Jonathans laptop. It was a fraught and frustrating experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My second presentation was done on &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/napalmgram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stuart Moores&lt;/a> MacBook Pro using Office Online for presentations and Azure for demos. Again a change right at the last minute and using a machine I didn&amp;rsquo;t know (and a different keyboard set-up).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stuff will go wrong. Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law will always show his head somewhere and no matter how often you test and re-test your demos, sometimes an odd thing will make them stop working&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be problems and issues, you can mitigate some of them by following the 6 P&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Proper Preparation Prevents Pretty Poor Performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You can read some great blog posts in this T-SQL Tuesday Series and also &lt;a class="link" href="https://voiceofthedba.wordpress.com/2016/10/13/why-i-practice-presentations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="you-never-know-you-might-enjoy-it">You never know you might enjoy it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I found I enjoyed it and wanted to do more and since then I have presented sessions in a wide variety of places. It was very strange to have been sat watching and listening to all of these fantastic presenters thinking I could never do that and then find out that actually it is something that I enjoy doing and find fun. You can do that too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equally, it&amp;rsquo;s ok to not enjoy it, think its not worth the stress and hassle and support the community in a different way but at least give it a go&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shared a train across Germany with someone who had attended the PSMonday conference in Munich and they were astonished when I said that I get very nervous before speaking. It&amp;rsquo;s ok to be nervous, the trick is to make use of that nervous energy and turn it into something positive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get very nervous before presentations. My hands shake, I sweat, I either babble or loose my voice. I fret and fidget and check everything a thousandillion times. I find it is better for me if I am sat in the room during the previous presentation as that generally helps me to feel more relaxed as I can listen to their talk and also out of respect for the presenter and the organisation it forces me to sit quietly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will find your own way to deal with this, maybe listening to music on headphones or just sitting quietly somewhere. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it is not immediately obvious, try some different things, talk with others and believe me, it will be ok.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t try to numb it with alcohol&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I get up and its &amp;lsquo;my&amp;rsquo; turn I take a few deep breaths and suddenly presenter turns on and I forget all about being nervous.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="something-to-talk-about">Something to talk about&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have nothing to talk about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or everyone else knows more than I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or X Y and Z talk about this much better than I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m scared&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/splappy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Richard Munn&lt;/a> and I gave an impromptu session at SQL Relay in Cardiff where we talked about and hopefully encouraged people to start speaking and these statements came up.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heres (a little of) what we said&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No-one knows everything. Many people know a hell of a lot but not everything. You know a lot more than you realise and you also know things that no-one else does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are stuck for things to talk about think about the you of 6 months or a year ago and something that you have learnt in that time and write the session that you wish you could have seen then. There will be other people at a similar stage who will appreciate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t be scared, they are only people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="practice">Practice&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My dog is the one person who has been present at my presentations the most. He has listened (sometimes intently) to me practicing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to practice speaking out loud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to understand the timings&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to be comfortable with hearing yourself speaking out aloud&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to practice speaking out loud&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A double reminder because I think it is important. You should practice and practice and practice with an eye on your timings and if you have a good friend who is technical or a small group at work for a lunchtime maybe then ask them if they will listen and give feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wanna-chat">Wanna chat?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am very passionate about community involvement and lucky enough to be involved in two fantastic communities - the SQL community and the PowerShell community and have made some great friends along the way. I was amazed and proud when very soon after my second presentation someone told me that I had inspired them to start to present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then I have gone out of my way to encourage other people to speak and to blog and am really enjoying watching them blossom. If you want to have a chat via email or via &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlps.io/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>slack&lt;/a> about speaking or blogging or getting involved in the community please feel free to contact me and I promise you I will get back to you. Better still go to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlps.io/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Community Slack&lt;/a> and ask questions in #presentingorspeaking&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="go-find-out-more">Go find out more&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are good at sharing and learning technical content but we can share and learn about so much more, about all aspects of our life. Go and read all of the other posts in this T-SQL Tuesday for starters :-) and develop&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons Learnt from my first talk at SQL SouthWest</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/lessons-learnt-from-my-first-talk-at-sql-southwest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/lessons-learnt-from-my-first-talk-at-sql-southwest/</guid><description>&lt;p>Edit 2022 -&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The timing was good enough that I could offer to do a talk based on my &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/azure/spinning-up-and-shutting-down-windows-azure-lab-with-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>previous post on Windows Azure&lt;/a> for my SQL User Group &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlsouthwest.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL SouthWest&lt;/a> when Jonathan and Annette.( &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/fatherjack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@FatherJack&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Mrs_Fatherjack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@MrsFatherJack&lt;/a>) put out a call for volunteers (Edit Sept 2020 - Brave enough to say now that Jonathan just told me I was doing it !! In the nicest possible way).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did my best with the &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Ps_%28military_adage%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>7 P’s&lt;/a>. I ran through it at lunchtime, I made sure I had power and a HDMI lead after checking with Jonathan, I got a glass of water. I knew the first line I was going to say&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I neglected to check that I would have HDMI in at the location so everything that was on my laptop was useless! My laptop did very odd things to the USB stick when I tried to transfer to Jonathans laptop and he didn’t have Powershell V3 installed so whilst Neil Hambly &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Hambly" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@Neil_Hambly&lt;/a> from Confio was speaking I was busy ignoring a very interesting talk on Waits to install and configure Powershell Azure on my Azure VM. Sorry Neil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in the end it more or less worked and we are lucky to have such a patient and supportive user group who helped me along the way as well. Thank you folks&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things I took away from the evening&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Double check you have all the connections&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practice and Practice some more&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think about the times when something is running and what you will say when there is nothing to see&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Presenting completely inside a RDP session adds unnecessary complication&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Demo Gods WILL hit you and the curse of the red text will fall upon you during the presentation. Accept it and move on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have an opening line&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember to breath (especially when the demo falls over)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enjoy it!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It didn’t go perfectly but people gave me some good feedback and I am pleased to say that I have pointed people towards something new that will help them and passed over my knowledge and that to me is what the SQL Community is all about. I have a load of other ideas for things I can talk about and blog about so it is going to be a very busy time for me as I work my way through them and do all the other exciting things coming my way in the SQL world.&lt;/p>
