&lt;p>When PASS announced that operations would cease, a common question was &amp;ldquo;OK, so what happens now? To SQL Saturdays?, to the summit?, to the local user groups?&amp;rdquo; The answers to some of those questions will lie in other conversations but for right now, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Local User Groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="user-groups">User Groups&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>User groups are a fantastic way to expand your knowledge and your network. A place to find like minded people performing similar roles that you can learn from and get support from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attending my local user group for the first time really helped me to improve. &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/you-have-to-start-somewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>At the time I was really struggling in my job with no idea how to get support from people who &lt;strong>know&lt;/strong> what should be done.&lt;/a> I joined the group, I made many friends and I learnt a lot. My OneNote is full of notes I have taken during User Group sessions. I became involved in running the user group and the associated SQL Saturday and then became aware of the wider community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are always very proud of the number of speakers who started their speaking career at our user group and have gone to great things. I too, &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/lessons-learnt-from-my-first-talk-at-sql-southwest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>started my speaking career at our user group&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our little user group in Exeter in the UK (or in Teams these days!) and user groups in general have a big place in my heart and I am a strong supporter of them. (If you would like a speaker, please always feel free to get in touch with me.) so I too, wondered&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is going to happen to the user groups now?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h1 id="microsoft-values-the-community">Microsoft Values The Community&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Microsoft have announced the support that they will be giving to user groups. You can watch Buck Woody &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/BuckWoodyMSFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>t&lt;/a> explain everything that the Microsoft Data Platform is doing to empower the community on Youtube &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/obFlSwpIihc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. (While you are there, I suggest subscribing to the channel, it&amp;rsquo;s really awesome)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft always has and always will support the technical professionals who use their products and they recognise that at the grass roots, the local user groups are the core of the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="so-microsoft-are-taking-over-the-user-groups">So Microsoft are taking over the User Groups?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>NO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s philosophy is that local user groups should be Community-owned but they can be Microsoft-empowered. They have created a series of assets, resources, and benefits for user group leaders to run their groups. I am astonished at the scale of what has been achieved in a short amount of time. There are a lot of benefits that will make it easier for user groups to have a stable presence and all the tools that they need to enable their user group .&lt;/p>
