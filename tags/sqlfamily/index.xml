not a creature was stirring not even old Maurice.&lt;br>
With merriment going on outside of his window&lt;br>
There sat a bearded DBA without much to do&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No changes can be made through the holiday season&lt;br>
We’re on skeleton support, which is a good reason&lt;br>
Ensure you are making the most of your time&lt;br>
You mustn’t be wasting the company dime&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The backups are checked, there isn’t an issue&lt;br>
So documentation writing should ensue&lt;br>
Instead he decided to procrastinate&lt;br>
And so, this little ditty he proceeded to create&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back over last year he did ruminate&lt;br>
About all the progress he had made, it was great&lt;br>
So much had been learned, so many improvements&lt;br>
Derived using content from fine ladies and gents&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Impossible to estimate how much it would cost&lt;br>
Or calculate the amount of revenue lost&lt;br>
For all that he would have been unable to do&lt;br>
Or the times that he knew how to get out of a stew&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But also the friends old, new and the rest&lt;br>
The talking and dining and drinking and jest&lt;br>
I am lucky to be a part of the SQL Family&lt;br>
So thank you one and all, with love from me&lt;/p>
