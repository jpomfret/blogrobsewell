&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-psday-">What is a PSDay ?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The International PowerShell community has three main global events which run over a number of days with top notch international speakers and Microsoft PowerShell team members, delivering in-depth information about the latest PowerShell trends and technologies, and connecting national communities with another.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://psconf.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>psconf.eu&lt;/a> covers the European communities, Hannover, Germany April 16-20 2018&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://psconf.asia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>psconf.asia&lt;/a> targets the Asian communities, Singapore October 27-28 2017&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PowerShell+DevOps Global Summit&lt;/a> targets the US communities April 9-12 2018&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are a number of other PowerShell events that have been organised by wonderful volunteers in numerous countries and we feel there is an opportunity to create national events which complement the global events and help PowerShell passionates and professionals to get in touch and learn from another with a similar branding of PSDay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We foresee PSDays to be smaller one day national events promoting speakers from the host country supported by other international speakers with the aim of increasing the exposure of national PowerShell user groups as well as providing excellent PowerShell training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be a board of PowerShell community folk set up who will approve requests to use the PSDay name and shield logo providing the event is professionally organized and offer help with technical questions, viral marketing, and experience. We hope that this will enable people to set up their own PSDay in their own country and increase the exposure of the PowerShell community as well as PowerShell knowledge whilst sharing resources, knowledge, experience and skills and ensuring a good standard of PowerShell community national events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further details of this will be forthcoming and we welcome offers of assistance from people with relevant experience&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
