&lt;p>When PASS announced that operations would cease, a common question was &amp;ldquo;OK, so what happens now? To SQL Saturdays?, to the summit?, to the local user groups?&amp;rdquo; The answers to some of those questions will lie in other conversations but for right now, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Local User Groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="user-groups">User Groups&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>User groups are a fantastic way to expand your knowledge and your network. A place to find like minded people performing similar roles that you can learn from and get support from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attending my local user group for the first time really helped me to improve. &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/you-have-to-start-somewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>At the time I was really struggling in my job with no idea how to get support from people who &lt;strong>know&lt;/strong> what should be done.&lt;/a> I joined the group, I made many friends and I learnt a lot. My OneNote is full of notes I have taken during User Group sessions. I became involved in running the user group and the associated SQL Saturday and then became aware of the wider community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are always very proud of the number of speakers who started their speaking career at our user group and have gone to great things. I too, &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/lessons-learnt-from-my-first-talk-at-sql-southwest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>started my speaking career at our user group&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our little user group in Exeter in the UK (or in Teams these days!) and user groups in general have a big place in my heart and I am a strong supporter of them. (If you would like a speaker, please always feel free to get in touch with me.) so I too, wondered&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is going to happen to the user groups now?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h1 id="microsoft-values-the-community">Microsoft Values The Community&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Microsoft have announced the support that they will be giving to user groups. You can watch Buck Woody &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/BuckWoodyMSFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>t&lt;/a> explain everything that the Microsoft Data Platform is doing to empower the community on Youtube &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/obFlSwpIihc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. (While you are there, I suggest subscribing to the channel, it&amp;rsquo;s really awesome)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft always has and always will support the technical professionals who use their products and they recognise that at the grass roots, the local user groups are the core of the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="so-microsoft-are-taking-over-the-user-groups">So Microsoft are taking over the User Groups?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>NO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s philosophy is that local user groups should be Community-owned but they can be Microsoft-empowered. They have created a series of assets, resources, and benefits for user group leaders to run their groups. I am astonished at the scale of what has been achieved in a short amount of time. There are a lot of benefits that will make it easier for user groups to have a stable presence and all the tools that they need to enable their user group .&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Community Leader Collaboration (via Teams &amp;amp; Meetup) enabling all the user groups leaders to be able to communicate, collaborate and share resources.&lt;/p>

>my last post about the Secret Management module&lt;/a>. I was asked another question.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Can I use this to run applications as my admin account?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A user with a beard&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is good practice to not log into your work station with an account with admin privileges. In many shops, you will need to open applications that can do administration tasks with another set of account credentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, people being people, they will often store their admin account credentials in a less than ideal manner (OneNote, Notepad ++ etc) to make it easier for them, so that when they right click and run as a different user, they can copy and paste the password.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-the-secret-management-module">Use the Secret Management module&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Again, I decided to use a notebook to show this as it is a fantastic way to share code and results and because it means that anyone can try it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The notebook may not render on a mobile device.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Using the notebook, I can quickly store my admin password safely and open and run the applications using the credential&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have to start here. For the longest time, whenever anyone has asked me how I store my credentials for use in my demos and labs I have always referred them to Jaap Brassers &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Jaap_Brasser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="joel-is-also-awesome">Joel is also awesome!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When people wanted a method of storing credentials that didn&amp;rsquo;t involve files on disk I would suggest Joel Bennett’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/jaykul" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>t&lt;/a> module BetterCredentials which uses the Windows Credential Manager&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In February, Microsoft released the SecretManagement module for preview.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sydney &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sydneysmithreal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>t&lt;/a> gave a presentation at the European PowerShell Conference which you can watch on Youtube.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="good-bye-import-clixml">Good Bye Import-CliXML&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So now I say, it is time to stop using Import-Clixml for storing secrets and use the Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretsManagement module instead for storing your secrets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="notebooks-are-as-good-as-blog-posts">Notebooks are as good as blog posts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I love notebooks and to show some people who had asked about storing secrets, I have created some. So, because I am efficient lazy I have embedded them here for you to see. You can find them in my Jupyter Notebook repository&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today, July 1st is the date that many MVPs receive their renewal email to let them know that they have been awarded for another year. There is a lot of F5’ing and frequent checking of emails and “Have you heard yet?” DMs going around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I received the news, I was using Azure DevOps to run PowerShell and Terraform to build an Azure SQL Elastic Pool (yes, I will write a blog post about it!). I love technology and within my work, like many people, I work across many different disciplines. Azure, Azure DevOps, SQL Server and Microsoft Data Platform products are the main focus of my time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn’t notice the significance of the information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was pleased as punch to be renewed again, proud that what I do is recognised by Microsoft, honoured to spend another year as an MVP. Then my friends pointed out the big news that I had missed.&lt;/p>
