&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQLBits&lt;/a> is the largest data platform conference in Europe. It has been running every year since 2007 in a different city in the UK providing sessions into all things data platform. I have frequently &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#sqlbits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>written about SQLBits&lt;/a>, it is close to my heart and has had a significant impact on my life, my career and my circle of friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="committee">Committee&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SQLBits committee is responsible for the running of the conference, the selection of general sessions and training days, helpers, sponsors, venue, dates, child care, theme, logo, the party, the website, charity support, hotels, bars, delegate app, helpers app, sponsors app, food, drinks, entertainment, prizes, swag, t-shirts, mugs, code of conduct, badges, printing, freight, stickers, lanyards, bags,on-site therapist, pens, notepads&amp;hellip; and everything else that goes into making SQLBits the best conference it can be!!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="before-the-conference">Before the conference&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have been meeting every week as a committee to plan the conference. Every committee member has also spent a lot of time in meetings, dealing with correspondence, answering questions, and then feeding this back to the whole committee. We received some feedback from one of our largest sponsors that one of the things that the liked about SQLBits was that we are all so passionate about the conference and that it really shows. We are all volunteers and we all have full time jobs, families, and other commitments but we are also determined to make SQLBits the best Microsoft Data Platform conference in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="set-up">Set up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We all arrived in Newport on the Sunday or the Monday before the conference to set up. Set up is a massive operation involving a significant number of people who turn the big empty room into the exhibition hall, build all of the sponsor booths, set up all of the rooms with a stage, screens, signage and projectors, ensure that there is wifi, power, and hard-wired internet access in them all. There was also a team taking all of the output from the speakers desk and ensuring that it will be available for the live streams for the online delegates. Whilst all of that is happening, we were unpacking all of the things that had been in storage (or peoples garages) getting all of the t-shirts for the helpers, for the speakers and for the committee. All of the speaker swag and delegate swag was put into a box or a bag by some of the orange shirted helpers.
We also had a &amp;ldquo;Meet the trainer&amp;rdquo; event in the evening which allowed delegates to come and interact with the speakers. This was a great opportunity for delegates to ask questions and get to know the trainers before the training days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was all expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are also things that happens behind the scenes during this time. For example, due to a storm over Northern Europe which impacted flights into and out of Schiphol, London and Bristol Airports as well as the trains running from London to Newport, there was a point on Monday afternoon where we were not sure that over half of our training day speakers for the next day would be able to make it. This lead to a couple of hours of manic phone calls and communication with the speakers as we tried our best to get them to the conference. We were very lucky that with only one exception, everyone made it to the conference. Unfortunately, despite best efforts and a lot of searching, one speaker was unable to get to the UK in time and so we had to switch their rooms to a room with virtual speakers enabled and update all of the schedules and teams involved in providing the content. These are the things that you don&amp;rsquo;t see, but that are part of the magic of ensuring that the conference runs smoothly. I hope all of the delegates and most of the speakers and sponsors have no idea of the things that were happening behind the scenes. I always describe it like a swan, it looks calm and serene on the surface, but underneath the water, there is a lot of paddling going on!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tuesday">Tuesday&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For me, Tuesday was a training day. With my fantastic partner in fun and games and sharing - Jess Pomfret &lt;a class="link" href="https://jesspomfret.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>B&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="https://tech.lgbt/@Jpomfret" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>M&lt;/a> we spent the whole day with about 75 people both in person and online and talked about how to manage large SQL estates. We had a lot of fun and I hope that everyone who attended enjoyed it as much as we did. We had a lot of questions and a lot of interaction with the delegates in both formats and it showed that the system that we had to enable virtual delegates for SQLBits really managed to work well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="equity-and-inclusivity">Equity and Inclusivity&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We had a lot of positive feedback from the delegates and we are really pleased that we were able to provide this opportunity for even more people to attend the conference. We are passionate about Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity and the feedback that we have received is that allowing virtual attendees enabled more people to attend the conference and to learn from the speakers. People who would not have been able to attend because of their family commitments or because of the cost of travel and accommodation were able to attend and this is one of our goals for the conference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concentrating on Inclusion and Equity will naturally have a positive impact on our Diversity and our goal is to make SQLBits a conference that is welcoming to everyone. The DE and I teams initiatives such as childcare are beginning to bear fruit and we are seeing more and more people attending the conference with their families, as well as more people from underrepresented groups attending the conference and we are working hard to ensure that we are providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="getting-everyone-in">Getting everyone in&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Whilst Jess and I were doing the training day, the rest of the team were ensuring that everyone was able to get in, with a badge, registered with the session that they expected, or the one they wished to change to. Some sessions had a limited number of places and so we had to ensure that the people who were on the waiting list were able to get into the session that they wanted to attend if places became available. We had to print the badges for the people who had signed up in the days before we sent the information to the printers. We had people paying for new tickets right up until Friday!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="wednesday">Wednesday&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>There was another &amp;ldquo;Meet the trainer&amp;rdquo; event on the Tuesday evening and another set of speakers and delegates who were arriving as well as sponsor teams and their freight. Wednesday morning did not see as much of a rush as Tuesday morning, but there was still a lot of people arriving and needing processing or having questions that needed answering. At events like SQLBits there is also a lot of communication and conversation with the venue. Ensuring that there is coffee at the times that everyone comes out of the rooms for breaks and that there is lunch at the right time. When you are thinking about lunch, you also need to think about the sponsors. On General sessions days we need to ensure that they can have lunch before all of the delegates come out of their sessions and they need to spend their time talking with them and demonstrating their products. Wednesday evening was also when the sponsors were able to setup their booths. This, of course, generates a large number of questions that need answering and boxes that need finding and then unpacking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="evening-events">Evening events&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Wednesday saw the first of the large evening events. We provided a games night with food. Thursday there was a quiz night with curry and Friday was the Party. As you can imagine, there is a significant amount of organisation required behind the scenes for all of these additional events. Food, drinks, prizes, the folks providing the entertainment and the helpers. The venue, security, transport from the hotels to the venue and back again. All of this needs to be organised and then managed on the day. We had a lot of fun at these events though and find them a great way to end each day and enable delegates who want to, to be able to network with each other and with the sponsors all whilst doing something fun. The party is organised by the wonderful, sparkly Julia and her team and they do a fantastic job of making sure that everyone has a great time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="general-sessions">General sessions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>General sessions then add further complexity, more delegates, more speakers, more moving parts that always have the possibility for things to require fixing. I have been a SQLBits helper and runner enough times to know that there were many things requiring attention, this year my responsibility was the agenda and updating the processes behind that when things changed and answering the myriad of questions that come up at the information desk. It is a lot of fun but also a lot of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap up&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This is a totally raw outpouring of my experience this year, pretty much without filter. Just so that I had it down somewhere in words.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLBits Agenda and PowerShell, displaying and searching</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/sqlbits-agenda-and-powershell-displaying-and-searching/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/sqlbits-agenda-and-powershell-displaying-and-searching/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2023/dragonsqlbitslogo.png" alt="Featured image of post SQLBits Agenda and PowerShell, displaying and searching" />&lt;h1 id="what-is-sqlbits">What is SQLBits?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQLBits&lt;/a> is the largest data platform conference in Europe. It has been running every year since 2007 in a different city in the UK providing sessions into all things data platform. I have frequently &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#sqlbits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>written about SQLBits&lt;/a>, it is a conference close to my heart and has had a significant impact on my life, my career and my circle of friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-and-when">Where and when?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This year it is in Newport, Wales at the International Convention Centre Wales (ICC) Tuesday 14th to Saturday 18th of March, 2023&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://events.sqlbits.com/2023/begin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>You can register to attend here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-there-at-sqlbits">What is there at SQLBits?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tuesday and Wednesday are training days with all day sessions provided by subject matter experts including Microsoft Product Group members, Microsoft Valued Professionals, Microsoft Certified Trainers, and other experts. There are 30 options covering all areas of the Data Platform and none-technical sessions as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the &lt;a class="link" href="https://events.sqlbits.com/2023/training-days" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>training day agenda here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thursday and Friday have 50 minute, 20 minute and 5 minute sessions with a wide range of topics and levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saturday is the &lt;strong>FREE to attend&lt;/strong> day. It also has 50 minute, 20 minute and 5 minute sessions with a wide range of topics and levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are about 250 sessions on Thursday, Friday and Saturday&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the &lt;a class="link" href="https://events.sqlbits.com/2023/agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>general session agenda here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-else-is-there-outside-of-technical-stuff">What else is there outside of technical stuff?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Oh My!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest benefit is the people, for networking, for answering questions, building relationships with Microsoft product group or local Microsoft, meeting companies who are sponsoring, finding your new job or your new team members, learning and sharing with your peers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also a pub quiz on Thursday evening, the Friday night costume party, the community zone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-do-i-find-the-sessions">How do I find the sessions?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With so many sessions, its hard to find the ones that you want or to get a good overview in the format that you want. So I built a PowerShell module to get that information for you easily in any format you like. (Editor - thats a fib, he built it so that he could write Pester to ensure that speakers were not scheduled when they were not available)&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-sqlbitsps-module">The SQLBitsPS module&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You can find the SQLBitsPS PowerShell module on the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SQLBitsPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PowerShell Gallery&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211528862-5226d25a-5642-44a3-9c14-f88bfa334aa2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with all PowerShell modules from the Gallery, you can install it by running&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Install-Module SQLBitsPS&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find that a lot of people like to use the &lt;code>ShowWindow&lt;/code> parameter to have the help in another searchable window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-Help Get-SQLBitsSchedule -ShowWindow&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211530034-596f0fc9-ec1d-43fc-bd7a-ff1cf01c7c15.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-the-help">Use the help&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>to find out how to use any PowerShell command you should use Get-Help and this module is no different. The help for the commands is built in and can be accessed with&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-Help Get-SQLBitsSchedule&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-the-schedule">Getting the schedule&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can just run &lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule&lt;/code> and by default it will get the schedule and if you have the &lt;code>ImportExcel&lt;/code> module available it will write an Excel Workbook with each days agenda on a different sheet and colour code the service sessions like Registration, lunch and coffee breaks&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211530884-1d2b2752-a729-499d-8334-1e4404199002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To save you having to click to open Excel I have added a &lt;code>Show&lt;/code> parameter which will open it for you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211531837-2396cfd5-b843-4fd8-8a90-d1e1a06e654f.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-would-like-a-csv-instead">I would like a csv instead&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>output&lt;/code> parameter gives you a number of options for the format of the output. If you do not have the &lt;code>ImportExcel&lt;/code> module it will default to &lt;code>-output csv&lt;/code> which you can also combine with the &lt;code>Show&lt;/code> parameter&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -output csv -show&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211532406-bc928085-ab6f-4d8c-b42e-edc53ce027ca.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="i-would-like-a-html-page-instead">I would like a html page instead&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not awesome but you can also create an HTML page. This may be useful if you wish to print the agenda yourself so that you have a hard copy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -output html -show&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211533198-9bd8c53f-71b1-4426-bc1f-d7a8e874a86a.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="let-me-decide-what-format-i-want">Let me decide what format I want&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can also output a &lt;code>[pscustomobject]&lt;/code> which you may use to PowerShell to your hearts content!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -output object |Format-Table&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211533959-ee9f2fb5-e4be-45f2-9142-581833ee214f.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Maybe you would like to see the sessions that are on Friday at 16:50&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -output object |Where-Object {$_.Day -eq 'Friday' -and $_.StartTime -eq '16:50'} &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211534901-f75cfc82-71bc-456e-bb2c-306dd753cf9b.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>They look amazing, I recommend Mladen Prajdic session. That one blew me away at Data Grillen and I may very well attend that again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-cant-do-anything-fancy-just-let-me-search">I can&amp;rsquo;t do anything fancy, just let me search&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If all you want is to search for your favourite speaker then you can use the &lt;code>search&lt;/code> parameter which will perform a wildcard search.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -search Cathrine -output object&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211536336-0202aec6-56f1-4f72-aa5b-4cc15de8f848.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>You can also use it search for topics&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have never had an official mentor but I am so very very grateful to all of the people who have helped, supported and inspired me throughout my career.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel so privileged to be able to reach out to so many wonderful people and ask questions and receive advice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-rob-why-do-you-mentor-others">So Rob, Why do you mentor others?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have always been willing to share everything that I know and have been doing so in various formats for many years now. I have officially mentored many people for presentations, through events such as New Stars of Data, Data (née SQL) Grillen, Data Minds, Data Scotland, as well as unofficially because they have asked me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I do this? because I enjoy it, because I believe that anyone can give a good presentation and because the more voices we have giving presentations the better that it is for us all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-the-best-thing-about-mentoring">What&amp;rsquo;s the best thing about mentoring?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So many things are fantastic about mentoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You learn so many things. Getting the opinions of different people or watching how others perform similar tasks to you almost always leads to you learning something new. Whether it is the subject they are talking about, or just the way that they use PowerPoint or VS Code, or even the way they have Windows set up there is always something to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also get such a warm fuzzy feeling from seeing people blossom as they gain confidence and realise that they can do a fantastic presentation and that it is a mainly a case of learning and practicing new skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am super proud of the people that I have mentored who have continued to present and have since presented at international conferences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am also equally proud of those who have decided that it was not for them right now and are currently taking a break from presenting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am delighted to see people who deserve it, become MVPs, or get promoted or change jobs. I hope that maybe I had a little impact, although I tell everyone I mentor, they are doing all of the hard work I am just listening and commenting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="doesnt-it-take-a-lot-of-time">Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it take a lot of time?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is, of course, a time element to being a mentor but I am always happy to give up a few hours each month to help and I am also careful that I don&amp;rsquo;t take on too much and over burden myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, being a mentor means giving guidance and setting goals and with a bit of careful planning you can be efficient about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-else-have-you-learnt">What else have you learnt?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have learnt that everyone is different and that, as a mentor, some of your tactics and procedures will not work for every person. As an example, I have learnt that some people like to have a script that they can use to memorise or to have as an aide whilst others are much happier just with key words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have learnt that time zones make it harder. If it is Sunday evening for me, it is Sunday morning on the west coast of the US. This can make it harder to find times that fit well for both parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-should-i-do">What should I do?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If someone asks or suggests that you do a presentation or become a mentor then I say that you should give it a try. They believe in you and so do I. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.newstarsofdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>for the suggestion to blog&lt;/a>. Check out #NewStarNovember for more blog posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It was around May of 2013 that I had written a blog post about spinning up and shutting down an Azure lab with PowerShell after being inspired at my first &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQLBits Conference&lt;/a> (On a side note, I have attended, volunteered or spoken at every one since and this year I was delighted to become a Committee Member - If you have comments/questions/advice please feel free to email me at rob at sqlbits.com). That blog post still exists &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/azure/spinning-up-and-shutting-down-windows-azure-lab-with-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the next SQL SouthWest User Group (as it was known then) Jonathan had said and next meeting we will have a session from Rob about PowerShell and Azure VMs. That was pretty much it. I thought why not give it a go. The worst that happens is that I don&amp;rsquo;t like it and don&amp;rsquo;t ever do it again. (Narrator - exactly the opposite happened - He loved it and does it &lt;a class="link" href="https://sessionize.com/rob-sewell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>at every opportunity&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was not the most brilliant presentation. I learned a lot and blogged about it too &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/lessons-learnt-from-my-first-talk-at-sql-southwest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>as you can read here&lt;/a>. But I enjoyed it and it gave me the confidence to do it again and set me on a path to the wonderful life I have now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="should-you-speak-at-your-user-group">Should you speak at your User Group?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Yes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, you want a bit more?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes you definitely should.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should try it once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your user group should be filled with some familiar faces of people who you know will support you and only want the best for you.
It will usually be a smaller group than at an event like a Data Saturday or other local to your town/city event.
Your user group leader will be delighted to help and to support you.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, you don&amp;rsquo;t ever have to do it again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-the-benefit-of-speaking">What is the benefit of speaking?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Why should you put yourself through all of that stress and work to put on a wonderful session? I think there are a number of benefits and most won&amp;rsquo;t come to you from doing a single session.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The first one does. You will know your subject more thoroughly. By preparing a session to present, you will definitely research, you will read blogs, you will try things out, you will want to make sure that you know all there is to know. This means that you will be improving your knowledge on the subject.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Confidence. Speaking in public will give you more confidence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It will improve your communication skills. You will have to be able to convey your message to others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people say that a job interview is like a presentation and you can improve that skill. (I am not sure but &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/i-hate-interviews-tsql2sday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>I hate interviews and don&amp;rsquo;t perform well&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It will improve your time management skills. You have to do a presentation on Monday, you need to get everything in place in time for that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are plenty of other reasons too.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-should-i-do">What should I do?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If someone asks or suggests that you do a presentation or become a mentor then I say that you should give it a try. They believe in you and so do I. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.newstarsofdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Blog&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/BenniDeJagere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Twitter&lt;/a> about how to show the keystrokes on the screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h1 id="it-depends">It depends&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The best answer is always &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo; and the correct response to this to determine how much to trust this information is &amp;ldquo;what does it depend uponW&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-does-it-depend-upon">what does it depend upon?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It depends upon which programme you are using and wish to demonstrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="visual-studio-code-or-azure-data-studio">Visual Studio Code or Azure Data Studio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are using &lt;a class="link" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5002693" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Visual Studio Code&lt;/a> or &lt;a class="link" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5002693" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Azure Data Studio&lt;/a> then you have it built in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can press &lt;code>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/code> and search for screencast&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/screencast.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/screencast.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="screencast"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if you toggle this on then the keystrokes are displayed on the screen as you type&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/display.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/display.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="displaying the keystrokes"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you &lt;code>CTRL+,&lt;/code> or click on the cog and then settings, you can search for screencast and there are a number of options available. In the screenshot below you can see that the mouse click is highlighted as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/withmouse.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/withmouse.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="screencast settings with mouse"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="something-else">Something else&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are wanting to demonstrate in a different application or when switching applications, you can use Carnac - &lt;a class="link" href="http://carnackeys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://carnackeys.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download the latest release and then run setup.exe and there will be a beautiful purple icon in the taskbar which if you click it will open the settings screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/carnacsettings.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/carnacsettings.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="carnac settings"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can click in any of the squares to decide where you would like the key presses to be displayed and as you can see it works with multiple monitors (although I had some issues with that). You can use the sliders to offset in any direction from the box as well and change the appearance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can even change the colour of the text as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/carnacdisplays.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/carnacdisplays.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="change colour"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To leave the application simple right click on the icon in the task bar and click Exit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy demonstrating!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kubernetes lab certificates expired</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/kubernetes-lab-certificates-expired/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/kubernetes-lab-certificates-expired/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494412651409-8963ce7935a7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1470&q=80" alt="Featured image of post Kubernetes lab certificates expired" />&lt;h1 id="it-wont-start">It won&amp;rsquo;t start!&lt;/h1>

&lt;h1 id="protecting-the-repository">Protecting the repository&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I opened the repository in the browser and GitHub and was provided with a warning that said&lt;/p>

alt="protect your branch"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clicking on the protect this branch button gave the reasoning.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Protect your most important branches
Branch protection rules define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks or a linear commit history.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So I changed the settings so that a Pull Request is required and needs to be reviewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/branchprotected.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/branchprotected.png"

&lt;h1 id="breaks-the-workflow">Breaks the workflow&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I had already altered the workflow trigger for the workflow to generate the speaker-list.json so that it would run when changes to the speakers directory were pushed to the main branch by adding&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>I then approved a PR with a change to that directory and saw that the workflow had started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then it failed :-(.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Of course, because I have now protected my branch, I cannot automatically push changes into the main branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="fix-it">Fix it&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>To fix this, I had to create a new PAT token with &lt;code>public_repo&lt;/code> scope and save it as a secret for the workflow to access and update the checkout to use this token.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="create-a-new-pat-token">Create a new PAT token&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The instructions to do this are found &lt;a class="link" href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>in the docs here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the left sidebar, click Developer settings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the left sidebar, click Personal access tokens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click Generate new token.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give your token a descriptive name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To give your token an expiration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select the scopes, or permissions, you&amp;rsquo;d like to grant this token.&lt;br>
For this scenario just choose &lt;code>public_repo&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click Generate token.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save the generated token somewhere safe like your password manager. ( You &lt;strong>do&lt;/strong> have a password manager? - Our family use 1Password)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="save-it-as-a-secret-in-the-repository">Save it as a secret in the repository&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You do not ever ever ever want to store secrets in source control. When using GitHub like this you can store your secrets in the settings of the repository &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>by following this guide&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>navigate to the main page of the repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under your repository name, click on the &amp;ldquo;Settings&amp;rdquo; tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the left sidebar, click Secrets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the right bar, click on &amp;ldquo;Add a new secret&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Type a name for your secret in the &amp;ldquo;Name&amp;rdquo; input box. I used &lt;code>REPO_TOKEN&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Type the value for your secret.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click Add secret.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="use-it-in-your-workflow">Use it in your workflow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that you have saved your secret, you can use it your workflows. To get rid of the protected branch error it is used in the &lt;code>actions/checkout&lt;/code> action like this&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>I remembered to do for both workflows!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then created a PR to test it and this time it was able to successfully push changes to the main branch&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/pushcompleted.png" >&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/pushcompleted.png"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and you can see &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/dataplat/DataSpeakers/commit/80d585ff1de15db22744ad5e7295294260b8fc98" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>the PR&lt;/a> if you wish.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="but-thats-not-all-folks">But thats not all folks&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This will work correctly for a PR and it will work for the initial workflow that has been called.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It &lt;em>&lt;strong>will not work&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> for the reusable workflow. When the reusable workflow is called from another workflow it is unable to pick up the token from the secrets. &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/dataplat/DataSpeakers/actions/runs/2659979920" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

This post will describe how the automation was created using a GitHub Issue and two GitHub Actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-we-need">What do we need?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The idea was to have a form for user input that could easily allow a person to add themselves and some information to a web page. The page holds a list of speakers who can present training day sessions for data platform events. &lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The web page can be found here&lt;/a>. This page is generated from a JSON file.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="a-new-repository">A new repository&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It was decided to use a GitHub repository to hold this information so that it is available publicly as well as via the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="create-a-dev-container">Create a dev container&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a brand new repository &lt;code>.devcontainer&lt;/code> directory was created and the files from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/powershell/.devcontainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Microsoft VS Code Remote / GitHub Codespaces Container Definitions repository PowerShell containers&lt;/a> added. This means that whenever I or anyone else wants to work on the repo the development experience will be the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="add-extensions">Add extensions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are a number of default extensions that I install for PowerShell or generic development&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.powershell" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ms-vscode.powershell&lt;/a> - because I am working with PowerShell&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2gua.rainbow-brackets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>2gua.rainbow-brackets&lt;/a> - because I like to easily see which opening bracket matches which closing bracket&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>oderwat.indent-rainbow&lt;/a> - so that I can quickly see the indentations, invaluable with YAML files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>usernamehw.errorlens&lt;/a> - so that linting errors are displayed in the editor alongside the code&lt;/li>

>TylerLeonhardt.vscode-inline-values-powershell&lt;/a> - so that you can see inline values when debugging&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I also added two more for this repository as we are using GitHub Actions&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=me-dutour-mathieu.vscode-github-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>People can update repositories using Pull Requests but this needed to be a little more guided and it was decided that it was to be done with &lt;a class="link" href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h1 id="process-the-information">Process the information&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now that we have a method of gathering the information, the next stage is to process it automagically. For this we are going to be &lt;a class="link" href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>using GitHub Actions&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="workflow">Workflow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GitHub Actions is a platform that can run automated processes called workflows that are defined as YAML files and triggered by events in the repository. We create another directory called &lt;code>workflows&lt;/code> also in the &lt;code>.github&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="triggering-the-workflow">Triggering the workflow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many people are comfortable with a DevOps process that will build, test and deploy code when a pull request is raised and approved, GitHub Actions are able to do more as they can be triggered by any events in the repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can automatically add labels, close stale issues and much more. There are a large number of events open to you as &lt;a class="link" href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>can be seen here &lt;/a>. Even looking at just issues there are a number of activities types that can be used&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>opened&lt;/li>
&lt;li>edited&lt;/li>
&lt;li>deleted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>transferred&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pinned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>unpinned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>closed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>reopened&lt;/li>
&lt;li>assigned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>unassigned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>labeled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>unlabeled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>locked&lt;/li>
&lt;li>unlocked&lt;/li>
&lt;li>milestoned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>demilestoned&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>(and there are separate ones for issue comments)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beginning of the workflow YAML file has the name and then the trigger. This triggers the workflow when an issue is opened.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We &lt;strong>&lt;em>use&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> a default &lt;strong>&lt;em>action&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> to checkout and because we push changes back to the repository (more on that later) we choose a &lt;code>fetch-depth&lt;/code> of 0 to get all of the history and the &lt;code>ref&lt;/code> main as that is the branch we are working with.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Whilst developing, I first saved the issue body to a file so that I could work with it. As I moved forward I forgot and just left the code in and it works. The issue form creates &lt;code>### &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code> and then a blank line and then the data that was entered. This enabled me to use some regex and capture each label, grab the data and put it in a &lt;code>pscustomobject&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I could convert it to Json and save it to a file. I chose to save each speakers information in their own file in case anything else would be needed in the future and also so that if the process failed it only affected this speakers information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also add the speaker file name to a text file that I may make use of at some future point.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself. The idea is to create the JSON file for the web-page from each of the speakers individual json files. People will want to change what they have entered or they will make mistakes, future functionality might require the same steps. With this in mind I created a separate workflow file to create the &lt;code>speaker-list.json&lt;/code> file. This used two different triggers&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>workflow_calls&lt;/code> so that it can be called from another workflow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>workflow_dispatch&lt;/code> so that it can be run manually&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The other workflow cannot be triggered manually as it relies on an issue to create the required file.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second workflow file uses a PowerShell action to combine the individual JSONs into a single one and commits that to the repository. It also comments on the issue but it can only do this if the workflow was triggered from the add speaker job and not manually so some conditional logic was required. There were a number of options that I could choose to decide if to run this step but I decided on using the event issue number &lt;code>if: github.event.issue.number != null&lt;/code> as if there was no issue, there was nothing to comment and this would leave this step open to be used in future coding if required.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>So we built a thing for speakers to add themselves and for events to find them&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think event organisers know who the &lt;em>big names&lt;/em> are and the topics that they can deliver for full day training sessions or pre-cons as they are also known. Finding other speakers and finding speakers who can deliver on different topics is a little more difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="hey-new-speakers">Hey New Speakers&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With all the &lt;em>*waves hand at world for the last 2 years&lt;/em> going on, there are a number of new speakers who have taken advantage of virtual events like &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.newstarsofdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>New Stars Of Data&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="https://datagrillen.com/dativerse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>DatiVerse&lt;/a> and other events that have helped to promote and support new speakers. This is truly awesome and I love seeing the pool of speakers growing and all the new voices enriching our learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are undoubtedly speakers who have content and can provide full day seesions that events and attendees will gladly have if only the organisers knew about the content and/or the speakers knew about the events.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="events-want-your-content">Events want your content&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This came up on social media and after a quick conversation with Daniel Hutmacher (&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/dhmacher" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Twitter&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlsunday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Blog&lt;/a>) we decided to create a resource page that can be found on &lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Call For Data Speakers&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Call For Data Speakers enables speakers to sign up to receive an email when a new event is announced. It also enables events to sign up, so that speakers can be notified when there is a call for speakers. So this seemed to be the obvious place to hold a list of speakers that event organisers can contact and show the topics that they can present full day or training day sessions on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="yes-even-you-please-join">YES even you. Please join.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I have created some automation that will make adding (and removing) yourself from this list easy to do. You can just go straight to &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/dataplat/DataSpeakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the repo&lt;/a> and follow the instructions if you dont want to read any more here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I see this as a resource for everybody, famouse or not, new or old. I absolutely want &lt;strong>you to add yourself&lt;/strong>, if you have content that can be used to provide a full day of training. Please don&amp;rsquo;t let imposter syndrome get in the way. Right now, all you are doing is listing your idea for people to see. Hopefully soon event organisers will get in touch and say hey I see you present on &amp;hellip; please would you submit to our event for a training day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Event organisers - You &lt;strong>do need to reach out to speakers&lt;/strong>. By adding some effort into finding speakers your event will be more rounded and of interest and benefit to a wider numebr of attendees and sponsors. I am talking about pre-con speakers here bu the same applies to general sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-do-i-do-it">How do I do it?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This process is all automated and driven by GitHub Issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="to-add-yourself-as-a-speaker">To add yourself as a speaker&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Open the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/dataplat/DataSpeakers/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Issues Page&lt;/a> and click new issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataplat/DataSpeakers/main/images/newissue.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="open a new issue"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click the get started button next to Add Speaker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataplat/DataSpeakers/main/images/emptyissue.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="empty issue"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fill in the details, the title can be anything that you like -&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Your full name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>topics you can provide training days or pre-cons for (dbatools, Index Tuning, DevOps for example) Add as many as you like.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Just topics&lt;/strong> not session titles or descriptions, those will be in your sessionize profile then this resource does not need updating so frequently. It is after all just a &amp;ldquo;Here I am, come find me&amp;rdquo; resource.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>regions that you would be willing to present training days or pre-cons in (these match the regions on callfordataspeakers.com)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your sessionize profile URl which will show the event organisers the precise sessions that you have and also your contact details/methods&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataplat/DataSpeakers/main/images/filledinsessions.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="new speaker info"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thats it, then press Submit new issue and the automation will do its thing&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-does-it-look-like">What does it look like?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A GitHub Action will run and &lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the web-page&lt;/a> will be updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can then search for topics, regions, click on any topic to see all the speakers that are happy to present on that topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click on a speaker and you will be directed to their Sessionize profile page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a quick look at the demo page after I had some test data in there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2022/07/callfordataprecons.png"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-else-can-i-do">What else can I do?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Please promote this resource. It will have no benefit if speakers do not add themselves and event organisers do not know about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would be really happy if you can keep this in mind if you are organising a data platform event, let any speakers know that this exists so that they can add themselves, share it on social media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many Thanks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitHub Pages in Dev Containers and Codespaces</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/github-pages-in-dev-containers-and-codespaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/github-pages-in-dev-containers-and-codespaces/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494961104209-3c223057bd26?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1102&q=80" alt="Featured image of post GitHub Pages in Dev Containers and Codespaces" />&lt;h1 id="broken-link">Broken Link&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Now this means that you get to see my awesome &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/justsomethingsad" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>404 page &lt;/a> which makes me laugh every time! It is not a very good look though and does not help people who are reading the blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-do-something-manual-when-you-can-automate-it">Why do something manual when you can automate it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This blog is running on GitHub Pages via a repository. Every time a change is pushed to the repo a GitHub Action runs which rebuilds the jekyll site and makes it available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the easy thing to do is to edit the code to add the corrected link, push the change and have GitHub Pages do its thing. If I wanted to validate it first then I could use docker and containers as discussed in these two blog posts &lt;a class="link" href="2021-04-11-locally-viewing-github-pages-new-data-saturdays.md" >Running GitHub Pages locally&lt;/a> or &lt;a class="link" href="2021-04-15-locally-viewing-github-pages-locally-with-remote-theme.md" >Running GitHub Pages locally with a Remote Theme (this site has a remote theme)&lt;/a>. Then I could see the changes locally before pushing them to the repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But my brain didn&amp;rsquo;t work in that way. Instead it thought &amp;ldquo;Hmmm maybe I could do this in the browser in &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>GitHub Codespaces&lt;/a> and then it could work locally as it will have a dev container (development container) configuration and VS Code will just open that in Docker itself, no need for running docker commands manually and I can write blog posts anywhere there is a browser or VS Code&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

>dbatools&lt;/a> Training Day at SQL Bits this year which we developed and ran using dev containers. We also presented a session at the &lt;a class="link" href="psconf.eu" >PowerShell Conference Europe&lt;/a> about using dev containers so I had a little knowledge of how it can be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-easy-is-it-">How easy is it ?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s super super easy. Surprisingly easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="open-a-codespace-for-your-repository">Open a codespace for your repository&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First I went to the repository for my website and opened a codespace by clicking on the green code button and creating a codespace&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="add-the-development-container-configuration">Add the development container configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Using &lt;code>CTRL SHIFT + P&lt;/code> to open the command palette and typing codespaces and choosing the Add Development Container Configuration Files&lt;/p>

loading="lazy"
alt="Add the configuration"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and follow the prompts&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Show All Definitions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jekyll&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bullseye (or buster if you use Apples)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-config-files-are-created">The config files are created&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This will create a &lt;code>.devcontainer&lt;/code> directory with&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>devcontainer.json&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dockerfile&lt;/li>
&lt;li>post-create.sh&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Which will do all that you need. You can stop here. You will just need to run &lt;code>jekyll serve&lt;/code> to start the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatic-regeneration">Automatic regeneration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To make it automatically regenerate. I added&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>bundle exec jekyll serve --force-polling&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to the end of the post-create.sh file. This will automatically start the website and regenerate it everytime I make a change :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="view-the-logs">View the logs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can watch the logs of the regeneration with View Creation Log from the command palette - Use &lt;code>CTRL SHIFT + P&lt;/code> to open it. Then you can see the log output in real-time.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="open-the-website-locally">Open the website &amp;ldquo;locally&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To open the website from inside the devcontainers the ports are exposed via the configuration. In the browser in codepaces there is a port tab and a button to press to open the website and show the updates that you have written.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you click that you get a live view of the website so that you can validate that it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="and-vs-code">And VS Code?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This showed it being created in codespaces in the browser, you can have the same effect in VS Code by adding a &lt;code>.devcontainer&lt;/code> directory and copying the files from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/v0.238.1/containers/jekyll/.devcontainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>vs code dev containers repo&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest is pretty much the same except the url!&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="do-you-need-to">Do you need to?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My first answer is do you need to see them? Once you have your theme set up as you like, you can view your blog in Visual Studio Code using the keyboard shortcut &lt;code>CTRL + K, V&lt;/code> and you can see a live preview of your post as you type.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>However, I appreciate that at some point you will probably want to see what your site looks like locally, so I decided to look at the blog posts in the theme locally for this blog. My &lt;a class="link" href="_posts%5c2021-04-10-locally-viewing-github-pages-new-data-saturdays.md" >last post&lt;/a> showed how I do this with the &lt;a class="link" href="https://datasaturdays.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Data Saturdays web-site&lt;/a> but I get an error when running this for my site because it cant find the gem sources. This is because I am using a remote theme for my blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/nogemsources.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/nogemsources.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="nogemsources"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I could do is work out how to get these in the right place, but I am lazy! Whilst researching for the Data Saturdays site, I had found another docker container, the official Jekyll one &lt;a class="link" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll&lt;/a>. I wondered if I could use that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="which-version-to-use">Which version to use?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First we need to know which version of Jekyll GitHub Pages is using. You can find all of that information here &lt;a class="link" href="https://pages.github.com/versions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://pages.github.com/versions/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/githubpagesversions.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/githubpagesversions.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="ghpagesversions"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we need to use 3.9.0&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so I ran&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker pull jekyll/jekyll:3.9&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/noimage.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/noimage.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="noimage"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so I tried 3.8.6 and it worked for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker pull jekyll/jekyll:3.8.6&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="set-up">Set up&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s back up a bit and set the environment up. I am using Docker on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) I installed it &lt;a class="link" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/03/02/docker-in-wsl2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>using this guide&lt;/a>. I believe this will work using native Docker, you would just need to replace the &lt;code>$PWD&lt;/code> in the example below with a dot &lt;code>.&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once that is installed and the image is pulled, I can then run my blog locally using&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker run --rm --volume=$PWD:/srv/jekyll -p 4001:4000 jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>or if not using WSL2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker run --rm --volume=.:/srv/jekyll -p 4001:4000 jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>--rm&lt;/code> means that the container will be removed when it is stopped, &lt;code>--volume=&amp;quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&amp;quot;&lt;/code> maps the current directory locally to the &lt;code>/srv/jekyll&lt;/code> directory in the container so I need to change the directory to my local repository for my blog. &lt;code>-p 4001:4000&lt;/code> says map port 4001 on my machine to port 4000 on the container. This means that I can view the blog locally at https://localhost:4001. &lt;code>jekyll serve&lt;/code> will build the site and run it for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="of-course-there-is-tweaking">Of course, there is tweaking&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have to make a few changes to make this work easily. When I run the site locally with this command I get the following error and the site would not build.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Liquid Exception: No repo name found. Specify using PAGES_REPO_NWO environment variables, &amp;lsquo;repository&amp;rsquo; in your configuration, or set up an &amp;lsquo;origin&amp;rsquo; git remote pointing to your github.com repository. in /_layouts/default.html&lt;br>
ERROR: YOUR SITE COULD NOT BE BUILT:&lt;br>
No repo name found. Specify using PAGES_REPO_NWO environment variables, &amp;lsquo;repository&amp;rsquo; in your configuration, or set up an &amp;lsquo;origin&amp;rsquo; git remote pointing to yocom repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/jekyllerror.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/jekyllerror.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="jekyllerror"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to fix this add the following to your &lt;code>_config.yml&lt;/code> file&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>repository: GITHUBUSERNAME/REPONAME&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>mine is&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>repository: SQLDBAWithABeard/robsewell&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then when I run the container I get another warning&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>GitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This does not really matter as the site still builds but another warning&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Auto-regeneration may not work on some Windows versions.
Please see: &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/216" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/216&lt;/a>
If it does not work, please upgrade Bash on Windows or run Jekyll with &amp;ndash;no-watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>means that the site will not auto-regenerate when you make a change and save the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We fix these errors by adding&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>github: [metadata]&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to the &lt;code>_config.yml&lt;/code> file&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and running the container with an extra switch for the jekyll command &lt;code>--force_polling&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-now-it-works">So now it works?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So with the additional data in the &lt;code>_config.yml&lt;/code> file and the new command&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker run --rm --volume=&amp;quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&amp;quot; -p 4001:4000 jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve --force_polling&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the site will build. You will still get the warning for auto-regeneration but it works. The purple arrow and the yellow box show the file that was changed and that it regenerated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/regenerate.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/regenerate.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="regenerate"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will only regenerate whilst running for blog post changes and not for configuration changes, such as altering the &lt;code>_config.yml&lt;/code> file. If you want to see those, you will have to stop the container and re-run it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one last problem however. When you write your blog posts in Jekyll you name the file YYYY-MM-DD-Nameoffile.md this will give the post time of YYYY-MM-DD but the file for this blog post is named with a date in the future and by default it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show. The green box shows the file name but there is no corresponding blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To fix this we add another entry to the &lt;code>_config.yml&lt;/code> file&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>future: true&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will tell Jekyll to show the posts with a data in the future. Unless you wish to show future posts on your blog when it is live, you will have to remember to change this to&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>future: false&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>when you push your changes to GitHub so that your blog behaves as expected but now you can see your current blog post and write away and be able to see how it will look in your theme&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/futureposts.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="lets-make-it-even-better">Let&amp;rsquo;s make it even better&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When you run the container, it will need to download all of the things it needs to run the site. This can take a little time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/downloadingthings.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/downloadingthings.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="downloadingthings"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be better if we had our own image that had all of those already downloaded for us. Let&amp;rsquo;s create our own image. We need to run our container without the &lt;code>rm&lt;/code> option this time as we need it not to be removed when we stop it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker run -volume=&amp;quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&amp;quot; -p 4001:4000 jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once it has finished downloading and installing all that it needs and generated the site press &lt;code>CTRL +C&lt;/code> to stop the container and run&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker ps -a&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>which will show you all of containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/dockerps.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/dockerps.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="dockerps"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use the first 3 characters of the container. In my example it is &lt;code>760&lt;/code>. If you have more than one, look for the one with the &lt;code>jekyll/jekyll:3.8.6&lt;/code> as the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we can create our own image using&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker commit 760 myblogimage&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>replace &lt;code>760&lt;/code> with your own container.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have created the image, you can remove the stopped container with&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker rm 760&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, replace &lt;code>760&lt;/code> with your own container.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="quicker-run">Quicker run&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now you can use your own image and the container will not need to download and install all of the things. Replace &lt;code>jekyll/jekyll:3.8&lt;/code> with &lt;code>myblogimage&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>docker run --rm --volume=&amp;quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&amp;quot; -p 4001:4000 myblogimage jekyll serve --force_polling&lt;/code>&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="now-we-have-to-update-the-web-site">Now we have to update the web-site&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The next challenge we face is to update the website. As the website is hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll, this means that we can easily update the website by updating the code and letting GitHub actions build the new site but we have no way of checking the way that it looks before we push the changes. With such a radical change required, I felt that it would be a good idea to explore how to do this locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="install-everything-you-need-locally">Install everything you need locally&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I examined the requirements to create a local development environment and this meant installing Jekyll and Ruby and a host of other things, there appeared to be a whole bundle of quirks and strange errors that may or may not need to be handled so I quickly went off that idea!!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="docker-to-the-rescue">Docker to the rescue&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a fantastic use case for using a Docker container. I can host all of the required bits inside a container, spin it up and down as I need it and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about polluting my machine with software and settings or the pain of having to configure it to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, other people have already done a lot of the work so I dont have to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am running Docker in WSL2. I followed these &lt;a class="link" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/03/02/docker-in-wsl2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>instructions&lt;/a> to set it up. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take very long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With thanks to Hans Kristian Flaatten &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/Starefossen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you are not using WSL but native Docker on Windows, then the command to run is slightly different&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>As soon as the container has started running and built the site I can see my changes locally in my browser at &lt;code>http://localhost:4000/&lt;/code> There are a few warnings as it builds that can be ignored. These are due to the autoomatic dynamic page generation code.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now I can make changes to the code in the website and save the file and the site will update. In the below video, you can see that I have updated the favicon so that the new logo appears.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a new process to create a Data Saturdays Event page, so I thought I would write an explanation and a run through&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-data-saturdays-">What is Data Saturdays ?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Firstly, not everyone will know what a Data Saturday event is, so lets start with that. There are two parts to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Data Saturday is an event that provides (usually free) training and information sessions about Azure Data and SQL Server. At present they are hosted online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Data Saturdays resource is an &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/datasaturdays" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>open-source repository&lt;/a> which enables event organisers to easily build a web presence as an entry point into their event. It integrates with other free event management solutions such as &lt;a class="link" href="https://sessionize.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Sessionize&lt;/a> enabling Call For Speakers, easily integrating the schedule, room links and speaker walls. The website is &lt;a class="link" href="https://datasaturdays.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://datasaturdays.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a screenshot of the first Data Saturday &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; Pordenone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/datasaturday1.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Pordenone"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The marvelous &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/spaghettidba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Gianluca Sartori&lt;/a> and I started this to enable Pordenone to hold an event. We open-sourced the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/datasaturdays" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>code&lt;/a> and hosted it in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Collaborative GitHub organisation&lt;/a> alongside community tools such as &lt;a class="link" href="https://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dbatools&lt;/a> with a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/DataSaturdays/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MIT licence&lt;/a> so that it is free for anyone to use and to collaborate with. The website is hosted on &lt;a class="link" href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>GitHub Pages&lt;/a> which generates static pages using &lt;a class="link" href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jekyll&lt;/a>. We figured that this not only enabled a quick free solution but also offered opportunities for people to enrich their skills by collaborating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wanted to include other community leaders to assist with guiding the project and we were proud that everyone we asked to be involved accepted. The people who are Admins of the project (who can approve changes to the code and therefore the website) in addition to Gianluca and I are : -&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have now enabled 10 Data Saturday events to exist, which we still think is amazing! However with growth comes challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-an-event-the-old-way">Creating an event the old way&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The old method of creating an event involved the organiser providing the required information and an admin creating the static HTML page. Copying and pasting, ensuring that the template stayed the same but the detail was altered. Of course, when things are done manually humans can make errors and we made errors. The beauty of hosting the website in code in GitHub is that we can quickly change the code when we notice and fix them but this was not ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automation-automation-automation-">Automation Automation AUTOMATION !&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I love automation, I get a real buzz out of taking manual monotonous tasks and automating them. I looked at the process we were following and took the bait and decided to automate it. I have created a data-driven process for creating and updating the event web-page and the rest of this blog post is an accompaniment to &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/DataSaturdays/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the official documentation in the Wiki in the Data Saturdays GitHub repository&lt;/a>. I might also blog about how I did it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you wish to just watch a video, you can find that here&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h2 id="creating-a-new-data-saturday-event">Creating a New Data Saturday Event&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How do you create a new event? The steps are laid out in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/DataSaturdays/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>wiki&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tooling">Tooling&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We suggest that you use &lt;a class="link" href="http://aka.ms/vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Visual Studio Code&lt;/a> as the editor to make these changes. Visual Studio Code is a superb free lightweight cross-platform code editor. To reduce the frustration we also suggest that you add the &lt;a class="link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>YAML Extension&lt;/a> to Visual Studio Code as this will help to identify any problems with YAML.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fork-the-data-saturdays-repository">Fork the Data Saturdays Repository&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have previously written a blog post that &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/source%20control/jupyter%20notebooks/azure%20data%20studio/dbatools/dbachecks/how-to-fork-a-github-repository-and-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>explains how to contribute to an open-source repository which you can also use as reference for some of these steps&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are using GitHub as the source control for the website, so you will need to signup for a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>GitHub account&lt;/a> if you do not have one already. This is free. Once you have that, navigate to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/datasaturdays" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Data Saturdays repository&lt;/a> and click on the Fork button&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/fork.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="fork"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will ask you where you want to fork it and you should choose your own GitHub account&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/forkwhere.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="forkwhere"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will only take a few seconds and you will have a fork of the repository in your own account.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="clone-the-repository-to-your-machine">Clone the Repository to your machine&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To work with the code, you need to clone it to your own machine (There are other options like &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>codespaces&lt;/a> which I love, but we will leave that for another time) Click on the green Code button and copy the URL using the button&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/cloneweb.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="cloneweb"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then in Visual Studio Code &lt;code>CTRL + SHIFT + P&lt;/code> will open the Command Palette and search for clone&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/clonevs.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="clonevs"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do not see Git:Clone you will need to install git from &lt;a class="link" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://git-scm.com/downloads&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="create-a-new-branch">Create a new branch&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You create a new branch to hold your changes by clicking on the branch name in the bottom left&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/branchchoose.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="branchchoose"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and give it a new name&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/newbranch.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="newbranch"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="create-the-markdown-file">Create the Markdown File&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now you can start to create the data for your event. First you need to see what the next available number is. Check the &lt;code>_data/events&lt;/code> directory to see what has gone before you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/getnextnumber.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="getnextnumber"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the &lt;code>_posts&lt;/code> directory, create a new file with the following naming convention &lt;code>YYYY-MM-DD-datasaturdayXXXX.md&lt;/code> where &lt;code>XXXX&lt;/code> is the next number available. An example name is &lt;code>2021-06-12-datasaturday0007.md&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the file you place the following content&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">4
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">5
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">6
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">7
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">8
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">---
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">layout: post
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">title: &amp;#34;The Name of the Data Saturday in double quotes&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">subtitle: &amp;#34;Data Saturday&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">tags: [event]

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">---
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>The 3 dashes are important to keep. The name must be in double quotes and the data must match your number. It should look like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/markdown.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="markdown"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Save the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="create-the-data-file">Create the data file.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is the most important file. This file is the one that will feed the page that you use. This is the file that you will update as your event timeline progresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the &lt;code>_data/events&lt;/code> directory create a new file named &lt;code>datasaturdayXXXX.yml&lt;/code> (The XXXX is your number again) example &lt;code>datasaturday0007.yml&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this file paste all the following&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">

&lt;td class="lntd">

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now you have to fill in your own data. The fields have explanations in them, the wiki has descriptions and you can always refer back to this blog post also. Some are obvious like name and date, some will take a little thought like description and some you won&amp;rsquo;t have yet like your Sessionize API URLs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This file can be altered any time that you like during your event timeline as more information becomes available or you wish to change things. Each time, you can create a Pull Request to the Data Saturdays repository but before that &lt;strong>It is really important&lt;/strong> that you check your YAML.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once your data file is ready&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="check-your-yaml">Check your YAML&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you have followed our advice and used Visual Studio Code and the YAML extension then you can check that your YAML is correctly formed by looking at the problems tab&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/noproblem.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="noproblem"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The example above has no problems so the YAML is correct. If it is not you will see&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/problem.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="problem"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally with YAML the problem is spaces, try to line up the text until the problem goes away.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sync-your-local-repository-with-github">Sync your local repository with GitHub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once your changes have been made, you will need to commit them with a commit message. We suggest that it is something relevant to your event&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/commit.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="commit"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you will need to press the publish button in Visual Studio Code to publish this branch to GitHub&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/publish.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="publish"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="create-a-pull-request-in-the-data-saturdays-repository">Create a Pull Request in the Data Saturdays Repository&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Last step is to create a Pull Request. Open your browser at your local GitHub repository. You will see a green button saying compare and pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com//assets/uploads/2021/createpr.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="createpr"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you click that it will automatically open a pull request for you. Add some details about who you are and your event and an admin will then review it and merge it. Once it has been merged, the site will be rebuilt and will include your new event page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="continue-to-update-your-event">Continue to update your event&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>AS you progress along your event timeline, you will need to edit the data file and create a new Pull Request. You will do this&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you get a new sponsor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you have enough volunteers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When your Call for Speaker closes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When your event is published and you have your SpeakerWall and Schedule API URLs from Sessionize&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To add links to your virtual rooms&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To add your feedback links&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After your event has finished&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As you change those things, create new Pull Requests, and they are merged, your event page will be updated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Surprised and Honoured and Proud</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/surprised-and-honoured-and-proud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/surprised-and-honoured-and-proud/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have always been extremely proud to be a Cloud and Datacenter Management MVP, and lucky enough to be involved with both the PowerShell community as well as the Data Platform community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, July 1st is the date that many MVPs receive their renewal email to let them know that they have been awarded for another year. There is a lot of F5’ing and frequent checking of emails and “Have you heard yet?” DMs going around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I received the news, I was using Azure DevOps to run PowerShell and Terraform to build an Azure SQL Elastic Pool (yes, I will write a blog post about it!). I love technology and within my work, like many people, I work across many different disciplines. Azure, Azure DevOps, SQL Server and Microsoft Data Platform products are the main focus of my time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn’t notice the significance of the information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was pleased as punch to be renewed again, proud that what I do is recognised by Microsoft, honoured to spend another year as an MVP. Then my friends pointed out the big news that I had missed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That is what I want from the contributors of this T-SQL Tuesday, those memories that they can think back on for sustenance. Like the humble cookie, I want a humble brag.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’m not good at bragging, &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>I’m generally convinced that all of you are better than me&lt;/a>. Yes, I am aware that it is irrational. This has made writing this post really hard. Sure, I get immense pleasure and satisfaction from solving a problem, that’s a form of instant fulfillment. Certainly, I enjoy teaching people and passing over my knowledge for them to use.&lt;br>
I am not going to write about technical things that I have done because they don’t give me sustenance in that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what does give me sustenance when times are hard?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The things I am most proud of are the things other people do where I have played a small part. These are the things I look back at and help to energise me. Things like&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A couple of people who I suggested started writing blogs and then speaking who are now seen as experts in their niche.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The people I mentored as new speakers who are now speaking all over the continent.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The most recent story was a DBA who sat in a full day pre-con at a SQL Saturday, took loads of notes and waited at the end to ask questions. We were looking at some code and she was telling me it wasn’t very good and apologising for it. It was good, it performed the required actions over a large estate and I told her so. I asked about her job and with a big sigh, she told a story of being stuck in a rut, dealing with a lot of legacy systems, not enjoying it and not being able to move on. We had a long talk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cut to this years SQL Bits and she came running up to me all energised. She has a new job, doing something “Cool in the cloud”, she said the things she had learned had helped her to land this role.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In all of these cases, it is the person involved who has done all of the hard work but it is these things that keep me going. The thank yous and the smiles I see on those peoples faces as they do the thing that they love and enjoy their success and progression 🙂&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hey, thats cake and not cookies Rob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know. The biggest thing that keeps me going when times are tough though is the security I am able to provide. Nearly 20 years ago my life was very different. Without a job, I’d had to give up a career, struggling dealing with my wife’s serious illnesses, suddenly responsible for the entire household without the means to provide, I was in a very bleak place and saw no way out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So to have found a career that is my hobby, to be able to work and also to have fun, to have a social world that provides me with friends and entertainment in many countries and the opportunity to experience different cultures and still be able to live comfortably. Thats a blessing and what keeps me going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also being able to pay my dad back for turning up with sacks of potatoes by taking him to football matches and comedy shows 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Acknowledge what you have got, tell your loved ones that you love them, enjoy life and use your cookies when you need them but don’t forget the cake 🙂&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A PowerShell Conference In A Book</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/a-powershell-conference-in-a-book/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/a-powershell-conference-in-a-book/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2018/08/book.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post A PowerShell Conference In A Book" />&lt;h2 id="a-question">A Question&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Shortly after the &lt;a class="link" href="http://psconf.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>European PowerShell Conference&lt;/a> and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PowerShell and Devops 2018&lt;/a> summit in the USA Mike Robbins &lt;a class="link" href="https://mikefrobbins.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>b&lt;/a> | &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/mikefrobbins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>t&lt;/a> contacted me with a question.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Interested in writing a chapter in a PowerShell book?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I was intrigued and read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-conference-in-a-book">A Conference in a Book&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There was more to this book than just writing about PowerShell though. Mike was suggesting that a group of wonderful PowerShell experts (&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/mikefrobbins/lists/psh-conference-book/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Here’s a Twitter list&lt;/a>) got together and created a conference in a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The book is designed as a conference in a book where each chapter is written independently with content similar to what you would present in a 45 minute presentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That’s a neat idea, people who couldn’t come to one of the conferences would be able to get an experience a little bit like attending a conference but in book form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK there would be no networking, evening entertainment or instance responses to questions but a bundle of useful information that you can take with you and read anywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="its-all-for-charity">It’s All For Charity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>(I hope older UK viewers read that &lt;a class="link" href="https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/JaggedGenuineGavial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>in this voice&lt;/a> 🙂 )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bit that clinched it for me was this though&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We’re donating all of the royalties from the book to the DevOps Collective Scholarship program &lt;a class="link" href="https://leanpub.com/causes/devopscollective" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://leanpub.com/causes/devopscollective&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>All the money raised by &lt;a class="link" href="https://leanpub.com/powershell-conference-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>buying this book&lt;/a> will go to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://powershell.org/summit/summit-onramp/onramp-scholarship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>DevOps Collective OnRamp Scholarship program&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scholarship provides&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ticket to PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit OnRamp track specifically designed for entry-level professionals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>five nights lodging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>domestic airfare&lt;/li>
&lt;li>buddy programme&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>and half of the slots are reserved for under-represented groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really approve of this idea, without the help and support of the SQL and PowerShell technical communities I would not be where I am today and this will help to bring other people in at an early stage in their career. I am proud that I can give a little back.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fabulous-editors">Fabulous Editors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So I said yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then had to sit down and write some words. I wrote about how we created &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbachecks.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dbachecks,&lt;/a> the challenges we faced and how we overcame them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my biggest challenges was writing in the wrong English! The book is written in American English and there are zeds where there should be esses and missing u’s in words! My spell checker was covered in red squiggles! The second challenge was getting the code to fit the column limit for the book. I show a lot of the AST code that we use to validate that dbachecks code will work correctly and it doesnt split to 80 characters very easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily I had 3 wonderful, patient editors to help me with all of this. &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/mikefrobbins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mike Robbins&lt;/a> , &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/barbariankb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Michael T Lombardi&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/JeffHicks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jeff Hicks&lt;/a> each helped me to make the chapter read more fluently, make sense and be spelled correctly!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you very much you three for all the work you have put into this book.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s TSQL Tuesday again! This month our host is Riley Major (&lt;a class="link" href="https://scribnasium.com/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>b&lt;/a>/&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/RileyMajor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>t&lt;/a>) and the subject is &lt;em>Giving Back&lt;/em>. He’s given us two options here (as well as the side option of &lt;em>your favorite 2017 improvement&lt;/em>). Pick a way that you’d like to give back to the community and talk about it, or if you already give back,  tell us how and why you started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be a lot of excellent posts on this subject and one of the things that I like is that you can go to &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://tsqltuesday.com&lt;/a> and look up all of the entries which means that for a particular topic you can find a bunch of blog posts from different angles (I miss-typed that as angels first and yes they are all angels!) whether it is &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com/tag/career-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>career improvement&lt;/a> or technical like say &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com/tag/extended-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Extended Events&lt;/a> it is all there waiting for you 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote about &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tsql2sday-giving-back-some-examples-and-encouragement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>giving back in 2014&lt;/a> when I was about to help organise SQL Saturday Exeter for the first time. Last year I blogged about a &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tsql2sday-folks-who-have-made-a-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>few of the wonderful people&lt;/a> who made a difference to me. So this post is a little about how I give back and also hopefully some hints that can help you to do the same as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how">How&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are so many ways that you can give back to the community as Riley’s post shows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sharing your knowledge is a good way. I share my knowledge in blog posts and in sessions at user groups and at conferences. You can too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From beginner, introductory posts and talks to expert level deep dives every single one of us has learned from the blog posts that other people have spent their time and effort creating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>YOU can share your knowledge, even if you have only been using a technology for a few months, you have knowledge of the things you have learned and the things that would have made it easier. Write a post about those things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Answering questions is another way. You can do this on &lt;a class="link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stack Overflow,&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Server Central&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="http://PowerShell.Org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PowerShell.Org&lt;/a> , Reddit, Facebook , on &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SQLHelp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Twitter using the #sqlhelp&lt;/a> or #PowerShellHelp or just in person. I try to answer questions when I see them on twitter or in the &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlps.io/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Community Slack&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mentoring or just providing feedback to people. You can offer to proof read blog posts or abstract submissions or you can listen to peoples presentations. I do this and it is a lot of fun&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also share my knowledge via &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sqldbawithabeard" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my GitHub&lt;/a>. All of my &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>presentations slides and code&lt;/a> are available as well as other code that I use. I also contribute to open-source projects such as &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dbatools&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbachecks.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dbachecks&lt;/a>.  You can do this too. You could open an issue for an improvement or bug. You can contribute your code, even if you are not confident writing the code you can fix spelling mistakes or add documentation., everything helps&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can help with organisation of events. I have helped to organise the PowerShell Europe Conference, PSDay.UK, SQL Saturday Exeter, SQL SouthWest user group, PASS PowerShell Virtual Group. I have also helped with session choices for a number of other events like &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlgrillen.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Grillen&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlgla.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQLGLA&lt;/a> and I have volunteered at many events from SQL Saturdays to SQL Bits. Everything from setting up and tearing down (IE moving heavy things and cleaning up rubbish) to sitting on the information desk, giving out badges, making sure the speakers are on time in their sessions. You can do this too. Just ask the organisers of the events what they need. It is better to do this prior to the event than on the day but I am sure all help is welcomed. &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sql_unicorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Richard Munn&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event17/Advice_and_guidance_on_becoming_a_speaker_or_volunteer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>I talked (waffled?) about this at SQL Bits this year&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to be considered as a volunteer for next years SQL Bits please email helpers at sqlbits.com&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So why did I start giving back?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to be useful. I saw the amount of work that Jonathan and Annette were doing organising SQL Saturday Exeter and SQL South West. I hoped that I could help them with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I carry on doing it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because it is fun 🙂 I enjoy speaking, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and talking to people&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is good but there is more to it as well&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You learn so much by writing a presentation or a blog post because you will do research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will learn even more when people ask you questions in your sessions or leave comments on your blog posts and you have to go and find the answers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You learn new and useful skills and demonstrate your knowledge to potential employers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My blog is a scrapbook of knowledge that I go back to and use all the time (and sometimes I forget that I have written something and find my own post in the search results!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the most important reason is that I feel that it pays back some of the benefit that I have gained from all of those people who’s time and effort I made use of for free when I was learning and continue to do so to this day. All of those blog posts and videos and presentations that I consumed have helped to make me the technician I am today. I have skills and abilities that I would not have without them all and by giving back I hope that I am enabling others to develop and see the benefit of sharing so that they will continue to do so in the future and I can learn from them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TSQL2sDay – Folks Who Have Made a Difference</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/tsql2sday-folks-who-have-made-a-difference/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/tsql2sday-folks-who-have-made-a-difference/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --></description></item><item><title>A Pretty PowerBi Pester Results Template File</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/a-pretty-powerbi-pester-results-template-file/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/a-pretty-powerbi-pester-results-template-file/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --></description></item><item><title>Announcing PSDay.UK – Whats a PSDay?</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/announcing-psday.uk-whats-a-psday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/announcing-psday.uk-whats-a-psday/</guid><description>&lt;p>On Thursday evening I attended the joint London WinOps and PowerShell User Group.

&lt;p>We already have some fantastic speakers lined up but we would like to invite people to send us submissions for more sessions. If you have a PowerShell talk that will fit into one of the tracks and experience of delivering sessions at events &lt;a class="link" href="https://psday.uk/submit-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-psday-">What is a PSDay ?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The International PowerShell community has three main global events which run over a number of days with top notch international speakers and Microsoft PowerShell team members, delivering in-depth information about the latest PowerShell trends and technologies, and connecting national communities with another.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://psconf.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>psconf.eu&lt;/a> covers the European communities, Hannover, Germany April 16-20 2018&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://psconf.asia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>psconf.asia&lt;/a> targets the Asian communities, Singapore October 27-28 2017&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PowerShell+DevOps Global Summit&lt;/a> targets the US communities April 9-12 2018&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are a number of other PowerShell events that have been organised by wonderful volunteers in numerous countries and we feel there is an opportunity to create national events which complement the global events and help PowerShell passionates and professionals to get in touch and learn from another with a similar branding of PSDay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We foresee PSDays to be smaller one day national events promoting speakers from the host country supported by other international speakers with the aim of increasing the exposure of national PowerShell user groups as well as providing excellent PowerShell training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be a board of PowerShell community folk set up who will approve requests to use the PSDay name and shield logo providing the event is professionally organized and offer help with technical questions, viral marketing, and experience. We hope that this will enable people to set up their own PSDay in their own country and increase the exposure of the PowerShell community as well as PowerShell knowledge whilst sharing resources, knowledge, experience and skills and ensuring a good standard of PowerShell community national events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further details of this will be forthcoming and we welcome offers of assistance from people with relevant experience&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2016 - That was a Year :-)</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/2016-that-was-a-year-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/2016-that-was-a-year-/</guid><description>&lt;p>Its the time of year for reflection and I have had the most amazing 2016, I am blessed that I love what I do so much.

&lt;p>I learnt about &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/pester/Pester" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>I spoke at the PowerShell Conference Europe and met and made some great friends which lead to me speaking at the PowerShell Monday in Munich and the Dutch PowerShell Usergroup. SQL Saturday Dublin was a blast, its a wonderful city, Manchester had a whole PowerShell Track :-) and Cambridge was memorable for the appalling journey as well as the chance to share a stage with &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/cl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Chrissy&lt;/a>. PowerShell Conference Asia in the sovereign city-state of Singapore was such a good event and place. Lastly of course was Slovenia with its fantastic Christmas lights and awesome event organisation. I visited some user groups too.

>The post on the SQLServer blog at TechNet by the SQL Server Tools Team today&lt;/a> made me jump out of my seat.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The July update for SSMS includes the first substantial improvement in SQL PowerShell in many years. We owe a lot of thanks for this effort to the great collaboration with our community. We have several new CMDLETs to share with you&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In one release there are &lt;strong>twenty-five&lt;/strong> new CMDLets for the new sqlserver module&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This means that if you have a PowerShell script doing &lt;em>Import-Module SQLPS&lt;/em>, it will need to be changed to be &lt;em>Import-Module SqlServer&lt;/em> in order to take advantage of the new provider functionality and new CMDLETs. The new module will be installed to &lt;em>“%Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\SqlServer&lt;/em>” and hence no update to $env:PSModulePath is required.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So SQLPS will still continue to work but will not be updated and will not contain the new CMDlets or the future new CMDlets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-what-new-things-do-we-have">So what new things do we have?&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This month we introduce CMDLETs for the following areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Always Encrypted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SQL Agent&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SQL Error Logs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>All four of us will be presenting a webinar on the new CMDlets via the &lt;a class="link" href="http://PowerShell.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="always-encrypted-cmdlets">Always Encrypted CMDlets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That leaves the Always Encrypted CMDLets and there are 17 of those!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>That seems to cover setting up Always Encrypted with PowerShell , removing it and getting information about it. When the new SSMS update is dropped you will be able to start using all of this new functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just remember Import-Module sqlserver&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So SQLBits has finished for another year. About 1500 people registered for the largest SQL Conference in Europe held over 4 days in Liverpool last week. 2 days of full day sessions and 2 days of shorter sessions, a pub quiz, a party (literally) out of this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is organised and run by volunteers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, you’re right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course we must pay special thanks to Simon, Darren, Chris, Jonathan, Annette, Allan and Alex without forgetting all that JRJ has done. They ensured that the venue, sessions, speakers, sponsors, audio visual and not forgetting the amazing party by &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sneaky Experience (Thank you Julia),&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> all occurred at the right time in the right place with the right people and the work and effort they have put in cannot be over-estimated but this post isn’t about those generous, inspiring, amazing folk
Several people asked me what a volunteer does and how they can become one and hopefully this post will answer both of those questions. More than 40 people volunteered to help at SQL Bits&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some volunteers arrived on Tuesday to help with the set up. Making sure that we knew where everything was and helping to lift and carry all of the things that needed moving.
&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/wp_20160504_07_13_44_pro-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wanted to begin the process of packing the swag bags so that all the attendees on Wednesday could have them as they arrived but unfortunately we were let down by a delivery firm and that was not possible. That job was completed by some very dedicated helpers during all of Wednesday and finished off by all helpers after Wednesdays sessions had finished. Many, many thanks and respect particularly to Bob and Conan for their dedication to the bag-packing cause, although I did hear “If I ever see another bag again ……..”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/bean-bags.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the registration desks with badges, lanyards and booklets were set up ready for the next day, the covers were put on the tables, the bean bags put out. (They were needed later!!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started every morning with a helpers briefing at 7am&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/wp_20160506_07_40_18_pro-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where we ensured that everyone knew what was happening that day. Most helpers took some part in registration whether it was being at the desks handing out badges, assisting speakers and sponsors on arrival with questions and some the other jobs that needed doing such as putting the table cloths on the tables in the domes and getting out the bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/wp_20160504_10_31_33_pro-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During every session there were two room monitors. Their responsibility was to ensure that everything went smoothly during the day and during each of the sessions on Friday and Saturday. They assisted the speaker with drinks, timings and the other foibles that technology can throw, they would have known what to do if there were issues with the domes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/dome-monitoring.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also made sure that everyone was in the correct session and answered lots of questions. The bit that hopefully most attendees missed was that in the case of any issues they called in one of the 5 or 6 super helpers who were patrolling the arena, who could go and get the AV guys or the venue staff to iron out the wrinkles, making sure that the water coolers got re-filled etc
They took all of your feedback forms and took them to the main desk. There were always people at the front desk helping, although Alex, Annette and Terri spent almost all of their time there.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course it doesn’t stop there. During the breaks and particularly at lunchtime the helpers were available and indeed noticeable. They assisted with the queues at lunchtime and for the key-note&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/wp_20160506_09_37_35_pro.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>answered questions and they helped attendees with session choices. There were always people and questions that they were willing to answer or to find someone who could.
Once the sessions had finished, the helpers didn’t. They manned and womanned the registration desks in the evening. Returned all of the feedback forms and helped with sorting out the venue ready for the next day. There was also a de-brief for any lessons learned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/wp_20160504_17_54_40_pro-21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They even gave out the free drinks tokens at the entrance to the party!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why do they do it? They are all part of this amazing community dedicated to providing great events for people to learn. Many of them are volunteers at other events and/or user group leaders and attendees and want to give something back to the community.) . They were able to choose the full day and hour sessions that they attended so were still able to learn from the amazing speakers at the brilliant sessions available. Everyone was able to choose which days they helped it doesn’t have to be for every day you are at the conference. They are a wonderful group of people and I have made some fantastic friendships by volunteering and get great hugs 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/wp_20160506_09_15_33_pro-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also get asked the most brilliant questions like “Excuse me, I have a Dalek in my van, what would you like me to do with it?”
If that sounds like something you would like to do, you just need to email &lt;a class="link" href="mailto:helpers@sqlbits.com" >helpers@sqlbits.com&lt;/a> with ‘I would like to be a helper next year at SQLBits’ in the subject. You can also offer to help at your local user group or at other events, speak to your user group leaders for more details on that
If it’s not for you, that’s cool but please, for me, the next time you see them at an event just say thank you. It really means a lot and they thoroughly deserve every word of thanks that we give them.&lt;/p>

>previous pos&lt;/a>t about parsing XML where I used the information from &lt;a class="link" href="https://voiceofthedba.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/downloading-sql-saturday-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Steve Jones blog post&lt;/a> to get information from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Saturday web site&lt;/a> I thought that this information and script may be useful for others performing the same task.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Edit - This post was written prior to the updates to the SQL Saturday website over the weekend. When it can back up the script worked perfectly but the website is unavailable at the moment again so I will check and update as needed once it is back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are looking at using &lt;a class="link" href="https://guidebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the Guidebook app&lt;/a> to provide an app for our attendees with all the session details for &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/372" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Saturday Exeter&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Guidebook admin website requires the data for the sessions in a certain format. You can choose CSV or XLS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the admin portal you can download the template&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/down.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/down.jpg?w=300"
loading="lazy"
alt="down"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>which gives an Excel file like this&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/excel.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/excel.jpg?w=300"
loading="lazy"
alt="-excel"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now all we need to do is to fill it with data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have an Excel Object Snippet which I use to create new Excel Objects when using PowerShell to manipulate Excel. Here it is for you. Once you have run the code you will be able to press CTRL + J and be able to choose the New Excel Object Snippet any time.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>I needed to change this to open the existing file by using&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$wb = $xl.Workbooks.Open($GuideBookPath)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the more help tab of the Excel workbook it says&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So we need to do some manipulation of the data we gather. As before I selected the information from the XML as follows&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1

&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">4
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">5
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$Speaker = @{Name=&amp;#34;Speaker&amp;#34;; Expression = {$_.speakers.speaker.name}}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$Room = @{Name=&amp;#34;Room&amp;#34;; Expression = {$_.location.name}}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$startTime = @{Name=&amp;#34;StartTime&amp;#34;; Expression = {[datetime]($_.StartTime)}}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$Endtime = @{Name =&amp;#34;EndTime&amp;#34;; Expression = {[datetime]($_.EndTime)}}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$Talks = $Sessions.event|Where-Object {$_.title -ne &amp;#39;Coffee Break&amp;#39; -and $_.title -ne &amp;#39;Room Change&amp;#39; -and $_.title -ne &amp;#39;Lunch Break&amp;#39; -and $_.title -ne &amp;#39;Raffle and Cream Tea&amp;#39;}| select $Speaker,$Room,$Starttime,$Endtime,Title,Description |Sort-Object StartTime
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>I then looped through the $Talks array and wrote each line to Excel like this&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>I know that I converted the String to DateTime and then back to a String again but that was the easiest (quickest) way to obtain the correct format for the Excel file&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then to finish save the file and quit Excel&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you upload the file in the Guidebook admin area &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/import.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>wait for the email confirmation and all your sessions are available in the guidebook&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Disclaimer – I am on the committee organising the next &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlsouthwest.co.uk/sqlsat269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQL Saturday Exeter&lt;/a>. To be kept up to date about SQL Saturday #269 in the South West, follow &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sqlsatexeter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@SQLSatExeter&lt;/a> and&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sqlsatexeter&amp;amp;src=hash&amp;amp;f=realtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>#SQLSatExeter&lt;/a> on twitter and see details at the bottom. This post is about my experience at this years event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In March this year the SQL South West User Group hosted SQL Saturday #194 in Exeter. I was a new member to the User Group having finally been able to join them for the first time in January. At that meeting Chris Testa O’Neill presented a session and was very passionate about the SQL Community and the benefit of the SQL Saturdays and other events.  I am always keen to learn new things and find ways of developing my skills. As I haven’t won the lottery I also look out for good deals as well!!&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sql-saturday-pre-cons-are-exceptional-value">SQL SATURDAY PRE-CONS ARE EXCEPTIONAL VALUE&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It was relatively easy to persuade my bosses to pay for my pre-con. For £150 I was able to spend a whole day in a room with about a dozen people being trained in SQL Server Security by Denny Cherry &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/@mrdenny" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@mrdenny&lt;/a>. The conversation went along the lines of&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I want to go to this training session being delivered by this guy. &lt;a class="link" href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Denny%20Cherry-4021851" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Link to MVP page&lt;/a>. It’s £150 and is in Exeter so no other costs required”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My boss – “OK”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course there was a little more fun and games to be had with the payment but it was easy for me to get training sorted and £150 is not going to break the training budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back through my notes from the session today I realise quite how much I have taken from it into my role at work. I can’t really comment which and what though that wouldn’t be good security!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember an enjoyable day with plenty of technical learning, a lot of questions and answers and plenty of laughs as well. But more than that was the opportunity to mix with other professionals and talk with them. During the breaks and at lunch there were plenty of opportunities to chew the fat, learn how others do things, make new friends and put faces to twitter handles. (NOTE : I do look pretty much like my &lt;a class="link" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/75950380/n675059923_1450.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>twitter profile picture&lt;/a> so if you see me at SQL Community events I expect you to come up and say hi, that&amp;rsquo;s part of the benefit of attending these events, having a good natter)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take a look at the end of this post for details of 2014 Pre-Cons&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sql-saturday--cant-get-cheaper-than-free">SQL SATURDAY – CAN’T GET CHEAPER THAN FREE&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>SQL Saturdays are FREE&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Saturdays offer sessions from internationally renowned and local SQL speakers on subjects relevant to you and your job, your future career, your development plan or just to challenge yourself by learning about something outside of your comfort zone. For Nothing. Add in the networking opportunities, the prizes from the sponsors, (if you were at Exeter this year the beer and the pasty) and if you added it up its a sizeable investment in yourself, your career and your development (did I mention a free beer and pasty?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NOT BAD FOR FREE!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable that, SQL Saturday organisers have to go out and talk sponsors into putting their hands into their pockets. They will only do that if it is worthwhile to them. You can make it easier for the organisers by going and spending time with the sponsors during the breaks, chatting with them and giving them your details. Also, if you choose to use one of their products please tell the sponsors you spoke to them at a SQL Saturday. They are (usually) data professionals who will record that and use that to make future decisions which will we hope include sponsoring SQL Saturdays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year on the Saturday I went to the following sessions&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A temporary fix for a short term problem by Ian Meade Advanced SQL Server 2012 HA and DR Architectures by Christian Bolton Busting common T-SQL myths by Dave Morrison Power View and the Cube by Régis Baccaro Natural Born Killers, performance issues to avoid by Richard Douglas Tracking server performance without slowing it down by Jonathan Allen which I also Room Monitored Increasing Business and IT collaboration by Chris Testa-O&amp;rsquo;Neill&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a really good day. I learnt so much from all those knowledgeable and talented people. It really kicked me on in my development at work. I was able to take from each of those sessions and use that knowledge to do my job better and I made new friends and new contacts. Just going back to my notes today has reminded me of something that I need to look into for work.
Some of the conversations I have had at events this year have been fascinating - learning how other people do the same thing you do in a completely different but equally valid way,  problem-solving with a different set and type of minds than the ones at MyWork, laughing at the same things and moaning about similar frustrations. All have been both entertaining and rewarding and I think are worth mentioning as things I enjoyed about going to SQL Community events this year and play a part in the reason I shall continue to go to them (Just hope my boss doesn&amp;rsquo;t read this and think he won’t have to pay as I will go anyway!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s busy and hectic, the sessions come along thick and fast and there are lots of people around to talk to. I wish I had made use of the SQL Saturday mobile phone app and I definitely recommend researching ahead of time and planning your day out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This years sessions have not been decided yet but I have seen some of the submissions and there are some fabulous sessions there. You could also submit a session yourself. Choosing the sessions will be tough, but we want to offer the opportunity to speak to as many people as possible both new and experienced speakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can submit your sessions at this link &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/269/callforspeakers.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h4 id="round-up-sql-saturday-exeter-why-wouldnt-you-come">ROUND-UP SQL SATURDAY EXETER WHY WOULDN’T YOU COME&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For a newbie, as I was last time, SQL Saturday Exeter was a revelation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An opportunity to learn without spending thousands of my own or MyWorks money to sit in a lecture room and listen to a trainer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A chance to develop my understanding in a friendly environment amongst my peers where I could ask questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A place to meet new people and build relationships who have helped me with situations at work throughout the year. I reckon I&amp;rsquo;m in credit already&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year I have attended SQL Bits and SQL Saturday Cambridge and this month I shall be at SQL Relay in Cardiff and in Bristol. That all started with SQL Saturday 194 in Exeter 2013&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-about-next-years-sql-saturday-exeter">WHAT ABOUT NEXT YEARS SQL SATURDAY EXETER?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Next years SQL Saturday in Exeter, SQL Saturday #269, will be held at the same place - &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.jurysinns.com/hotels/exeter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jury’s Inn Hotel Exeter&lt;/a> on March 21/22nd 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had such amazing submissions for our pre-cons that we have had to find more rooms to be able to fit them all in.. You can see for yourself the quality of the sessions and speakers for SQL Saturday Exeter 2014 at the following link&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlsouthwest.co.uk/sql-saturday-269-precon-training-day-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>What do you think? I want to split myself into 8 and go to every one!&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-should-you-do-now">WHAT SHOULD YOU DO NOW?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I suggest that you should book Saturday 22nd March 2014 out in your calendar right this minute. Done that? Good.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This bit is up to you, the choice is hard. I can’t tell you which one of our eight fabulous sessions you want to go to. It’s not for me to say which amazing speaker you want to spend a day with for a bargain price but if you need further info please get in touch and we will try and help. Unfortunately our human cloning experiment is not stable enough to allow you to go to more than one!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, let me know you have done so and come and say hi when you are here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
