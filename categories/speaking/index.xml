&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQLBits&lt;/a> is the largest data platform conference in Europe. It has been running every year since 2007 in a different city in the UK providing sessions into all things data platform. I have frequently &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#sqlbits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>written about SQLBits&lt;/a>, it is close to my heart and has had a significant impact on my life, my career and my circle of friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="committee">Committee&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SQLBits committee is responsible for the running of the conference, the selection of general sessions and training days, helpers, sponsors, venue, dates, child care, theme, logo, the party, the website, charity support, hotels, bars, delegate app, helpers app, sponsors app, food, drinks, entertainment, prizes, swag, t-shirts, mugs, code of conduct, badges, printing, freight, stickers, lanyards, bags,on-site therapist, pens, notepads&amp;hellip; and everything else that goes into making SQLBits the best conference it can be!!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="before-the-conference">Before the conference&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have been meeting every week as a committee to plan the conference. Every committee member has also spent a lot of time in meetings, dealing with correspondence, answering questions, and then feeding this back to the whole committee. We received some feedback from one of our largest sponsors that one of the things that the liked about SQLBits was that we are all so passionate about the conference and that it really shows. We are all volunteers and we all have full time jobs, families, and other commitments but we are also determined to make SQLBits the best Microsoft Data Platform conference in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="set-up">Set up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We all arrived in Newport on the Sunday or the Monday before the conference to set up. Set up is a massive operation involving a significant number of people who turn the big empty room into the exhibition hall, build all of the sponsor booths, set up all of the rooms with a stage, screens, signage and projectors, ensure that there is wifi, power, and hard-wired internet access in them all. There was also a team taking all of the output from the speakers desk and ensuring that it will be available for the live streams for the online delegates. Whilst all of that is happening, we were unpacking all of the things that had been in storage (or peoples garages) getting all of the t-shirts for the helpers, for the speakers and for the committee. All of the speaker swag and delegate swag was put into a box or a bag by some of the orange shirted helpers.
We also had a &amp;ldquo;Meet the trainer&amp;rdquo; event in the evening which allowed delegates to come and interact with the speakers. This was a great opportunity for delegates to ask questions and get to know the trainers before the training days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was all expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are also things that happens behind the scenes during this time. For example, due to a storm over Northern Europe which impacted flights into and out of Schiphol, London and Bristol Airports as well as the trains running from London to Newport, there was a point on Monday afternoon where we were not sure that over half of our training day speakers for the next day would be able to make it. This lead to a couple of hours of manic phone calls and communication with the speakers as we tried our best to get them to the conference. We were very lucky that with only one exception, everyone made it to the conference. Unfortunately, despite best efforts and a lot of searching, one speaker was unable to get to the UK in time and so we had to switch their rooms to a room with virtual speakers enabled and update all of the schedules and teams involved in providing the content. These are the things that you don&amp;rsquo;t see, but that are part of the magic of ensuring that the conference runs smoothly. I hope all of the delegates and most of the speakers and sponsors have no idea of the things that were happening behind the scenes. I always describe it like a swan, it looks calm and serene on the surface, but underneath the water, there is a lot of paddling going on!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tuesday">Tuesday&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For me, Tuesday was a training day. With my fantastic partner in fun and games and sharing - Jess Pomfret &lt;a class="link" href="https://jesspomfret.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>B&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="https://tech.lgbt/@Jpomfret" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>M&lt;/a> we spent the whole day with about 75 people both in person and online and talked about how to manage large SQL estates. We had a lot of fun and I hope that everyone who attended enjoyed it as much as we did. We had a lot of questions and a lot of interaction with the delegates in both formats and it showed that the system that we had to enable virtual delegates for SQLBits really managed to work well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="equity-and-inclusivity">Equity and Inclusivity&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We had a lot of positive feedback from the delegates and we are really pleased that we were able to provide this opportunity for even more people to attend the conference. We are passionate about Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity and the feedback that we have received is that allowing virtual attendees enabled more people to attend the conference and to learn from the speakers. People who would not have been able to attend because of their family commitments or because of the cost of travel and accommodation were able to attend and this is one of our goals for the conference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concentrating on Inclusion and Equity will naturally have a positive impact on our Diversity and our goal is to make SQLBits a conference that is welcoming to everyone. The DE and I teams initiatives such as childcare are beginning to bear fruit and we are seeing more and more people attending the conference with their families, as well as more people from underrepresented groups attending the conference and we are working hard to ensure that we are providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="getting-everyone-in">Getting everyone in&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Whilst Jess and I were doing the training day, the rest of the team were ensuring that everyone was able to get in, with a badge, registered with the session that they expected, or the one they wished to change to. Some sessions had a limited number of places and so we had to ensure that the people who were on the waiting list were able to get into the session that they wanted to attend if places became available. We had to print the badges for the people who had signed up in the days before we sent the information to the printers. We had people paying for new tickets right up until Friday!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="wednesday">Wednesday&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>There was another &amp;ldquo;Meet the trainer&amp;rdquo; event on the Tuesday evening and another set of speakers and delegates who were arriving as well as sponsor teams and their freight. Wednesday morning did not see as much of a rush as Tuesday morning, but there was still a lot of people arriving and needing processing or having questions that needed answering. At events like SQLBits there is also a lot of communication and conversation with the venue. Ensuring that there is coffee at the times that everyone comes out of the rooms for breaks and that there is lunch at the right time. When you are thinking about lunch, you also need to think about the sponsors. On General sessions days we need to ensure that they can have lunch before all of the delegates come out of their sessions and they need to spend their time talking with them and demonstrating their products. Wednesday evening was also when the sponsors were able to setup their booths. This, of course, generates a large number of questions that need answering and boxes that need finding and then unpacking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="evening-events">Evening events&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Wednesday saw the first of the large evening events. We provided a games night with food. Thursday there was a quiz night with curry and Friday was the Party. As you can imagine, there is a significant amount of organisation required behind the scenes for all of these additional events. Food, drinks, prizes, the folks providing the entertainment and the helpers. The venue, security, transport from the hotels to the venue and back again. All of this needs to be organised and then managed on the day. We had a lot of fun at these events though and find them a great way to end each day and enable delegates who want to, to be able to network with each other and with the sponsors all whilst doing something fun. The party is organised by the wonderful, sparkly Julia and her team and they do a fantastic job of making sure that everyone has a great time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="general-sessions">General sessions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>General sessions then add further complexity, more delegates, more speakers, more moving parts that always have the possibility for things to require fixing. I have been a SQLBits helper and runner enough times to know that there were many things requiring attention, this year my responsibility was the agenda and updating the processes behind that when things changed and answering the myriad of questions that come up at the information desk. It is a lot of fun but also a lot of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap up&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This is a totally raw outpouring of my experience this year, pretty much without filter. Just so that I had it down somewhere in words.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLBits Agenda and PowerShell, displaying and searching</title><link>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/sqlbits-agenda-and-powershell-displaying-and-searching/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/blog/sqlbits-agenda-and-powershell-displaying-and-searching/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sqldbawithabeard.github.io/blogrobsewell/assets/uploads/2023/dragonsqlbitslogo.png" alt="Featured image of post SQLBits Agenda and PowerShell, displaying and searching" />&lt;h1 id="what-is-sqlbits">What is SQLBits?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQLBits&lt;/a> is the largest data platform conference in Europe. It has been running every year since 2007 in a different city in the UK providing sessions into all things data platform. I have frequently &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#sqlbits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>written about SQLBits&lt;/a>, it is a conference close to my heart and has had a significant impact on my life, my career and my circle of friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-and-when">Where and when?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This year it is in Newport, Wales at the International Convention Centre Wales (ICC) Tuesday 14th to Saturday 18th of March, 2023&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://events.sqlbits.com/2023/begin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>You can register to attend here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-there-at-sqlbits">What is there at SQLBits?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tuesday and Wednesday are training days with all day sessions provided by subject matter experts including Microsoft Product Group members, Microsoft Valued Professionals, Microsoft Certified Trainers, and other experts. There are 30 options covering all areas of the Data Platform and none-technical sessions as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the &lt;a class="link" href="https://events.sqlbits.com/2023/training-days" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>training day agenda here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thursday and Friday have 50 minute, 20 minute and 5 minute sessions with a wide range of topics and levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saturday is the &lt;strong>FREE to attend&lt;/strong> day. It also has 50 minute, 20 minute and 5 minute sessions with a wide range of topics and levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are about 250 sessions on Thursday, Friday and Saturday&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the &lt;a class="link" href="https://events.sqlbits.com/2023/agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>general session agenda here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-else-is-there-outside-of-technical-stuff">What else is there outside of technical stuff?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Oh My!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest benefit is the people, for networking, for answering questions, building relationships with Microsoft product group or local Microsoft, meeting companies who are sponsoring, finding your new job or your new team members, learning and sharing with your peers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also a pub quiz on Thursday evening, the Friday night costume party, the community zone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-do-i-find-the-sessions">How do I find the sessions?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With so many sessions, its hard to find the ones that you want or to get a good overview in the format that you want. So I built a PowerShell module to get that information for you easily in any format you like. (Editor - thats a fib, he built it so that he could write Pester to ensure that speakers were not scheduled when they were not available)&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-sqlbitsps-module">The SQLBitsPS module&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You can find the SQLBitsPS PowerShell module on the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SQLBitsPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PowerShell Gallery&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211528862-5226d25a-5642-44a3-9c14-f88bfa334aa2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with all PowerShell modules from the Gallery, you can install it by running&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Install-Module SQLBitsPS&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find that a lot of people like to use the &lt;code>ShowWindow&lt;/code> parameter to have the help in another searchable window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-Help Get-SQLBitsSchedule -ShowWindow&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211530034-596f0fc9-ec1d-43fc-bd7a-ff1cf01c7c15.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-the-help">Use the help&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>to find out how to use any PowerShell command you should use Get-Help and this module is no different. The help for the commands is built in and can be accessed with&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-Help Get-SQLBitsSchedule&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-the-schedule">Getting the schedule&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can just run &lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule&lt;/code> and by default it will get the schedule and if you have the &lt;code>ImportExcel&lt;/code> module available it will write an Excel Workbook with each days agenda on a different sheet and colour code the service sessions like Registration, lunch and coffee breaks&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211530884-1d2b2752-a729-499d-8334-1e4404199002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To save you having to click to open Excel I have added a &lt;code>Show&lt;/code> parameter which will open it for you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211531837-2396cfd5-b843-4fd8-8a90-d1e1a06e654f.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="image"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-would-like-a-csv-instead">I would like a csv instead&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>output&lt;/code> parameter gives you a number of options for the format of the output. If you do not have the &lt;code>ImportExcel&lt;/code> module it will default to &lt;code>-output csv&lt;/code> which you can also combine with the &lt;code>Show&lt;/code> parameter&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -output csv -show&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211532406-bc928085-ab6f-4d8c-b42e-edc53ce027ca.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="i-would-like-a-html-page-instead">I would like a html page instead&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not awesome but you can also create an HTML page. This may be useful if you wish to print the agenda yourself so that you have a hard copy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -output html -show&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211533198-9bd8c53f-71b1-4426-bc1f-d7a8e874a86a.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="let-me-decide-what-format-i-want">Let me decide what format I want&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can also output a &lt;code>[pscustomobject]&lt;/code> which you may use to PowerShell to your hearts content!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -output object |Format-Table&lt;/code>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Maybe you would like to see the sessions that are on Friday at 16:50&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -output object |Where-Object {$_.Day -eq 'Friday' -and $_.StartTime -eq '16:50'} &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211534901-f75cfc82-71bc-456e-bb2c-306dd753cf9b.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>They look amazing, I recommend Mladen Prajdic session. That one blew me away at Data Grillen and I may very well attend that again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-cant-do-anything-fancy-just-let-me-search">I can&amp;rsquo;t do anything fancy, just let me search&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If all you want is to search for your favourite speaker then you can use the &lt;code>search&lt;/code> parameter which will perform a wildcard search.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Get-SQLBitsSchedule -search Cathrine -output object&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/211536336-0202aec6-56f1-4f72-aa5b-4cc15de8f848.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>You can also use it search for topics&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have never had an official mentor but I am so very very grateful to all of the people who have helped, supported and inspired me throughout my career.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel so privileged to be able to reach out to so many wonderful people and ask questions and receive advice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-rob-why-do-you-mentor-others">So Rob, Why do you mentor others?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have always been willing to share everything that I know and have been doing so in various formats for many years now. I have officially mentored many people for presentations, through events such as New Stars of Data, Data (née SQL) Grillen, Data Minds, Data Scotland, as well as unofficially because they have asked me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I do this? because I enjoy it, because I believe that anyone can give a good presentation and because the more voices we have giving presentations the better that it is for us all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-the-best-thing-about-mentoring">What&amp;rsquo;s the best thing about mentoring?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So many things are fantastic about mentoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You learn so many things. Getting the opinions of different people or watching how others perform similar tasks to you almost always leads to you learning something new. Whether it is the subject they are talking about, or just the way that they use PowerPoint or VS Code, or even the way they have Windows set up there is always something to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also get such a warm fuzzy feeling from seeing people blossom as they gain confidence and realise that they can do a fantastic presentation and that it is a mainly a case of learning and practicing new skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am super proud of the people that I have mentored who have continued to present and have since presented at international conferences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am also equally proud of those who have decided that it was not for them right now and are currently taking a break from presenting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am delighted to see people who deserve it, become MVPs, or get promoted or change jobs. I hope that maybe I had a little impact, although I tell everyone I mentor, they are doing all of the hard work I am just listening and commenting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="doesnt-it-take-a-lot-of-time">Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it take a lot of time?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is, of course, a time element to being a mentor but I am always happy to give up a few hours each month to help and I am also careful that I don&amp;rsquo;t take on too much and over burden myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, being a mentor means giving guidance and setting goals and with a bit of careful planning you can be efficient about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-else-have-you-learnt">What else have you learnt?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have learnt that everyone is different and that, as a mentor, some of your tactics and procedures will not work for every person. As an example, I have learnt that some people like to have a script that they can use to memorise or to have as an aide whilst others are much happier just with key words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have learnt that time zones make it harder. If it is Sunday evening for me, it is Sunday morning on the west coast of the US. This can make it harder to find times that fit well for both parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-should-i-do">What should I do?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If someone asks or suggests that you do a presentation or become a mentor then I say that you should give it a try. They believe in you and so do I. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.newstarsofdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>for the suggestion to blog&lt;/a>. Check out #NewStarNovember for more blog posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It was around May of 2013 that I had written a blog post about spinning up and shutting down an Azure lab with PowerShell after being inspired at my first &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SQLBits Conference&lt;/a> (On a side note, I have attended, volunteered or spoken at every one since and this year I was delighted to become a Committee Member - If you have comments/questions/advice please feel free to email me at rob at sqlbits.com). That blog post still exists &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/azure/spinning-up-and-shutting-down-windows-azure-lab-with-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the next SQL SouthWest User Group (as it was known then) Jonathan had said and next meeting we will have a session from Rob about PowerShell and Azure VMs. That was pretty much it. I thought why not give it a go. The worst that happens is that I don&amp;rsquo;t like it and don&amp;rsquo;t ever do it again. (Narrator - exactly the opposite happened - He loved it and does it &lt;a class="link" href="https://sessionize.com/rob-sewell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>at every opportunity&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was not the most brilliant presentation. I learned a lot and blogged about it too &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/lessons-learnt-from-my-first-talk-at-sql-southwest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>as you can read here&lt;/a>. But I enjoyed it and it gave me the confidence to do it again and set me on a path to the wonderful life I have now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="should-you-speak-at-your-user-group">Should you speak at your User Group?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Yes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, you want a bit more?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes you definitely should.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should try it once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your user group should be filled with some familiar faces of people who you know will support you and only want the best for you.
It will usually be a smaller group than at an event like a Data Saturday or other local to your town/city event.
Your user group leader will be delighted to help and to support you.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, you don&amp;rsquo;t ever have to do it again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-the-benefit-of-speaking">What is the benefit of speaking?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Why should you put yourself through all of that stress and work to put on a wonderful session? I think there are a number of benefits and most won&amp;rsquo;t come to you from doing a single session.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The first one does. You will know your subject more thoroughly. By preparing a session to present, you will definitely research, you will read blogs, you will try things out, you will want to make sure that you know all there is to know. This means that you will be improving your knowledge on the subject.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Confidence. Speaking in public will give you more confidence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It will improve your communication skills. You will have to be able to convey your message to others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people say that a job interview is like a presentation and you can improve that skill. (I am not sure but &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/i-hate-interviews-tsql2sday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>I hate interviews and don&amp;rsquo;t perform well&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It will improve your time management skills. You have to do a presentation on Monday, you need to get everything in place in time for that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are plenty of other reasons too.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-should-i-do">What should I do?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If someone asks or suggests that you do a presentation or become a mentor then I say that you should give it a try. They believe in you and so do I. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.newstarsofdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
